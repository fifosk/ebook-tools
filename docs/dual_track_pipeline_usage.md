Outputs land under `audio/` and `timing/`, with per-lane JSON files named
`timing/<lane>/<chunk>.timing.json`.

## 2. Timing format reference
Use `modules.core.rendering.timing_schema` for serialization helpers and
`scripts/validate_word_timing.py` to sanity-check tracks. Both expect:

- sentences stored with `sid`, `start`, `end`, and `words[]`
- per-word timings already bucketed (default 10 ms)
- track duration roughly matching the last sentence

## 3. Frontend demo wiring
`web/src/components/demo/DualLaneSandbox.tsx` exercises a dual-lane gating flow with:

- `web/src/utils/buildSlides.ts` for slide/gate construction
- `web/src/player/SentenceGateController.ts` for gate timing + audio playback
- `web/src/stores/gateStore.ts` and `web/src/hooks/useDualLaneHighlighting.ts` for state & wiring

Feed the sandbox the paths generated by the pipeline (e.g., via `Vite` dev server) to verify
highlighting and per-lane gating before integrating into the main player UI.

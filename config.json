        "Her narrow black eyes narrowed themselves still more, the long line of her scarlet mouth curved faintly upwards.",
        "Enthusiastic Frenchmen continued to beat the ground appreciatively as the curtain fell with a swish, hiding the reds",
        "and blues and magentas of the bizarre d\u00e9cor .",
        "In a swirl of blue and orange draperies the dancer left the stage.",
        "A bearded gentleman received her enthusiastically in his arms.",
        "It was the Manager. \u2018Magnificent, petite , magnificent,\u2019 he cried. \u2018Tonight you have surpassed yourself.\u2019 He kissed her",
        "gallantly on both cheeks in a somewhat matter-of-fact manner.",
        "Madame Nadina accepted the tribute with the ease of long habit and passed on to her dressing-room, where",
        "bouquets were heaped carelessly everywhere, marvellous garments of futuristic design hung on pegs, and the air was hot",
        "and sweet with the scent of the massed blossoms and with the more sophisticated perfumes and essences.",
        "Jeanne, the dresser, ministered to her mistress, talking incessantly and pouring out a stream of fulsome compliments.",
        "A knock at the door interrupted the flow, Jeanne went to answer it, and returned with a card",
        "in her hand. \u2018Madame will receive?\u2019 \u2018Let me see.\u2019 The dancer stretched out a languid hand, but at",
        "the sight of the name on the card, \u2018Count Sergius Paulovitch\u2019, a sudden flicker of interest came into",
        "her eyes. \u2018I will see him.",
        "The maize peignoir , Jeanne, and quickly.",
        "And when the Count comes you may go.\u2019 \u2018 Bien, Madame. \u2019 Jeanne brought the peignoir , an",
        "exquisite wisp of corn-coloured chiffon and ermine.",
        "Nadina slipped into it, and sat smiling to herself, whilst one long white hand beat a slow tattoo",
        "on the glass of the dressing table.",
        "The Count was prompt to avail himself of the privilege accorded to him\u2013a man of medium height, very",
        "slim, very elegant, very pale, extraordinarily weary.",
        "In feature, little to take hold of, a man difficult to recognize again if one left his mannerisms",
        "out of account.",
        "He bowed over the dancer\u2019s hand with exaggerated courtliness. \u2018Madame, this is a pleasure indeed.\u2019 So much Jeanne",
        "heard before she went out, closing the door behind her.",
        "Alone with her visitor, a subtle change came over Nadina\u2019s smile. \u2018Compatriots though we are, we will not",
        "speak Russian, I think,\u2019 she observed. \u2018Since we neither of us know a word of the language, it",
        "might be as well,\u2019 agreed her guest.",
        "By common consent, they dropped into English, and nobody, now that the Count\u2019s mannerisms had dropped from him,",
        "could doubt that it was his native language.",
        "He had, indeed, started life as a quick-change music-hall artiste in London. \u2018You had great success tonight,\u2019 he",
        "remarked. \u2018I congratulate you.\u2019 \u2018All the same,\u2019 said the woman, \u2018I am disturbed.",
        "My position is not what it was.",
        "The suspicions aroused during the War have never died down.",
        "I am continually watched and spied upon.\u2019 \u2018But no charge of espionage was ever brought against you?\u2019 \u2018Our",
        "chief lays his plans too carefully for that.\u2019 \u2018Long life to the \u201cColonel\u201d,\u2019 said the Count, smiling. \u2018Amazing",
        "news, is it not, that he means to retire?",
        "To retire!",
        "Just like a doctor, or a butcher, or a plumber\u2013\u2019 \u2018Or any other business man,\u2019 finished Nadina. \u2018It",
        "should not surprise us.",
        "That is what the \u201cColonel\u201d has always been\u2013an excellent man of business.",
        "He has organized crime as another man might organize a boot factory.",
        "Without committing himself, he has planned and directed a series of stupendous coups , embracing every branch of",
        "what we might call his \u201cprofession\u201d.",
        "Jewel robberies, forgery, espionage",
        "the latter very profitable in war-time",
        ", sabotage, discreet assassination, there is hardly anything he has not touched.",
        "Wisest of all, he knows when to stop.",
        "The game begins to be dangerous?\u2013he retires gracefully\u2013with an enormous fortune!\u2019 \u2018H\u2019m!\u2019 said the Count doubtfully. \u2018It is",
        "rather\u2013upsetting for all of us.",
        "We are at a loose end, as it were.\u2019 \u2018But we are being paid off\u2013on a most generous",
        "scale!\u2019 Something, some undercurrent of mockery in her tone, made the man look at her sharply.",
        "She was smiling to herself, and the quality of her smile aroused his curiosity.",
        "But he proceeded diplomatically: \u2018Yes, the \u201cColonel\u201d has always been a great paymaster.",
        "I attribute much of his success to that\u2013and to his invariable plan of providing a suitable scapegoat.",
        "A great brain, undoubtedly a great brain!",
        "And an apostle of the maxim, \u201cIf you want a thing done safely, do not do it yourself!\u201d",
        "Here are we, every one of us incriminated up to the hilt and absolutely in his power, and",
        "not one of us has anything on him.\u2019 He paused, almost as though he were expecting her to",
        "disagree with him, but she remained silent, smiling to herself as before. \u2018Not one of us,\u2019 he mused.",
        "\u2018Still, you know, he is superstitious, the old man.",
        "Years ago, I believe, he went to one of these fortune-telling people.",
        "She prophesied a lifetime of success, but declared that his downfall would be brought about through a woman.\u2019",
        "He had interested her now.",
        "She looked up eagerly. \u2018That is strange, very strange!",
        "Through a woman you say?\u2019 He smiled and shrugged his shoulders. \u2018Doubtless, now that he has\u2013retired, he will",
        "marry.",
        "Some young society beauty, who will disperse his millions faster than he acquired them.\u2019 Nadina shook her head.",
        "\u2018No, no, that is not the way of it.",
        "Listen, my friend, tomorrow I go to London.\u2019 \u2018But your contract here?\u2019 \u2018I shall be away only one",
        "night.",
        "And I go incognito, like Royalty.",
        "No one will ever know that I have left France.",
        "And why do you think that I go?\u2019 \u2018Hardly for pleasure at this time of the year.",
        "January, a detestable foggy month!",
        "It must be for profit, eh?\u2019 \u2018Exactly.\u2019 She rose and stood in front of him, every graceful line",
        "of her arrogant with pride. \u2018You said just now that none of us had anything on the chief.",
        "You were wrong.",
        "I have.",
        "I, a woman, have had the wit and, yes, the courage\u2013for it needs courage\u2013to double-cross him.",
        "You remember the De Beer diamonds?\u2019 \u2018Yes, I remember.",
        "At Kimberley, just before the war broke out?",
        "I had nothing to do with it, and I never heard the details, the case was hushed up",
        "for some reason, was it not?",
        "A fine haul too.\u2019 \u2018A hundred thousand pounds\u2019 worth of stones.",
        "Two of us worked it\u2013under the \u201cColonel\u2019s\u201d orders, of course.",
        "And it was then that I saw my chance.",
        "You see, the plan was to substitute some of the De Beer diamonds for some sample diamonds brought",
        "from South America by two young prospectors who happened to be in Kimberley at the time.",
        "Suspicion was then bound to fall on them.\u2019 \u2018Very clever,\u2019 interpolated the Count approvingly. \u2018The \u201cColonel\u201d is always",
        "clever.",
        "Well, I did my part\u2013but I also did one thing which the \u201cColonel\u201d had not foreseen.",
        "I kept back some of the South American stones\u2013one or two are unique and could easily be proved",
        "never to have passed through De Beers\u2019 hands.",
        "With these diamonds in my possession, I have the whip-hand of my esteemed chief.",
        "Once the two young men are cleared, his part in the matter is bound to be suspected.",
        "I have said nothing all these years, I have been content to know that I had this weapon",
        "in reverse, but now matters are different.",
        "I want my price\u2013and it will be big, I might almost say a staggering price.\u2019 \u2018Extraordinary,\u2019 said the",
        "Count. \u2018And doubtless you carry these diamonds about with you everywhere?\u2019 His eyes roamed gently around the disordered",
        "room.",
        "Nadina laughed softly. \u2018You need suppose nothing of the sort.",
        "I am not a fool.",
        "The diamonds are in a safe place where no one will dream of looking for them.\u2019 \u2018I never",
        "thought you a fool, my dear lady, but may I venture to suggest that you are somewhat foolhardy?",
        "The \u201cColonel\u201d is not the type of man to take kindly to being blackmailed, you know.\u2019 \u2018I am",
        "not afraid of him,\u2019 she laughed. \u2018There is only one man I have ever feared\u2013and he is dead.\u2019",
        "The man looked at her curiously. \u2018Let us hope that he will not come to life again, then,\u2019",
        "he remarked lightly. \u2018What do you mean?\u2019 cried the dancer sharply.",
        "The Count looked slightly surprised. \u2018I only meant that resurrection would be awkward for you,\u2019 he explained. \u2018A",
        "foolish joke.\u2019 She gave a sigh of relief. \u2018Oh, no, he is dead all right.",
        "Killed in the war.",
        "He was a man who once\u2013loved me.\u2019 \u2018In South Africa?\u2019 asked the Count negligently. \u2018Yes, since you ask",
        "it, in South Africa.\u2019 \u2018That is your native country, is it not?\u2019 She nodded.",
        "Her visitor rose and reached for his hat. \u2018Well,\u2019 he remarked, \u2018you know your own business best, but,",
        "if I were you, I should fear the \u201cColonel\u201d far more than any disillusioned lover.",
        "He is a man whom it is particularly easy to\u2013underestimate.\u2019 She laughed scornfully. \u2018As if I did not",
        "know him after all these years!\u2019 \u2018I wonder if you do?\u2019 he said softly. \u2018I very much wonder",
        "if you do.\u2019 \u2018Oh, I am not a fool!",
        "And I am not alone in this.",
        "The South African mail-boat docks at Southampton tomorrow, and on board her is a man who has come",
        "specially from Africa at my request and who has carried out certain orders of mine.",
        "The \u201cColonel\u201d will have not one of us to deal with, but two.\u2019 \u2018Is that wise?\u2019 \u2018It is",
        "necessary.\u2019 \u2018You are sure of this man?\u2019 A rather peculiar smile played over the dancer\u2019s face. \u2018I am",
        "quite sure of him.",
        "He is inefficient, but perfectly trustworthy.\u2019 She paused, and then added in an indifferent tone of voice: \u2018As",
        "a matter of fact, he happens to be my husband.\u2019 Chapter 1 Everybody has been at me, right",
        "and left, to write this story, from the great",
        "represented by Lord Nasby",
        "to the small",
        "represented by our late maid-of-all-work, Emily, whom I saw when I was last in England. \u2018Lor, miss, what",
        "a beyewtiful book you might make out of it all\u2013just like the pictures!\u2019",
        "I\u2019ll admit that I\u2019ve certain qualifications for the task.",
        "I was mixed up in the affair from the very beginning, I was in the thick of it",
        "all through, and I was triumphantly \u2018in at the death\u2019.",
        "Very fortunately, too, the gaps that I cannot supply from my own knowledge are amply covered by Sir",
        "Eustace Pedler\u2019s diary, of which he has kindly begged me to make use.",
        "So here goes.",
        "Anne Beddingfeld starts to narrate her adventures.",
        "I\u2019d always longed for adventures.",
        "You see, my life had such a dreadful sameness.",
        "My father, Professor Beddingfeld, was one of England\u2019s greatest living authorities on Primitive Man.",
        "He really was a genius\u2013everyone admits that.",
        "His mind dwelt in Palaeolithic times, and the inconvenience of life for him was that his body inhabited",
        "the modern world.",
        "Papa did not care for modern man\u2013even Neolithic Man he despised as a mere herder of cattle, and",
        "he did not rise to enthusiasm until he reached the Mousterian period.",
        "Unfortunately one cannot entirely dispense with modern men.",
        "One is forced to have some kind of truck with butchers and bakers and milkmen and greengrocers.",
        "Therefore, Papa being immersed in the past, Mamma having died when I was a baby, it fell to",
        "me to undertake the practical side of living.",
        "Frankly, I hate Palaeolithic Man, be he Aurignacian, Mousterian, Chellian, or anything else, and though I typed and",
        "revised most of Papa\u2019s Neanderthal Man and his Ancestors , Neanderthal men themselves fill me with loathing, and",
        "I always reflect what a fortunate circumstance it was that they became extinct in remote ages.",
        "I do not know whether Papa guessed my feelings on the subject, probably not, and in any case",
        "he would not have been interested.",
        "The opinion of other people never interested him in the slightest degree.",
        "I think it was really a sign of his greatness.",
        "In the same way, he lived quite detached from the necessities of daily life.",
        "He ate what was put before him in an exemplary fashion, but seemed mildly pained when the question",
        "of paying for it arose.",
        "We never seemed to have any money.",
        "His celebrity was not of the kind that brought in a cash return.",
        "Although he was a fellow of almost every important society and had rows of letters after his name,",
        "the general public scarcely knew of his existence, and his long learned books, though adding signally to the",
        "sum-total of human knowledge, had no attraction for the masses.",
        "Only on one occasion did he leap into the public gaze.",
        "He had read a paper before some society on the subject of the young of the chimpanzee.",
        "The young of the human race show some anthropoid features, whereas the young of the chimpanzee approach more",
        "nearly to the human than the adult chimpanzee does.",
        "That seems to show that whereas our ancestors were more Simian than we are, the chimpanzee\u2019s were of",
        "a higher type than the present species\u2013in other words, the chimpanzee is a degenerate.",
        "That enterprising newspaper, the Daily Budget , being hard up for something spicy, immediately brought itself out with",
        "large headlines. \u2018 We are not descended from monkeys, but are monkeys descended from us ?",
        "Eminent Professor says chimpanzees are decadent humans.\u2019 Shortly afterwards, a reporter called to see Papa, and endeavoured to",
        "induce him to write a series of popular articles on the theory.",
        "I have seldom seen Papa so angry.",
        "He turned the reporter out of the house with scant ceremony, much to my secret sorrow, as we",
        "were particularly short of money at the moment.",
        "In fact, for a moment I meditated running after the young man and informing him that my father",
        "had changed his mind and would send the articles in question.",
        "I could easily have written them myself, and the probabilities were that Papa would never have learnt of",
        "the transaction, not being a reader of the Daily Budget .",
        "However, I rejected this course as being too risky, so I merely put on my best hat and",
        "went sadly down the village to interview our justly irate grocer.",
        "The reporter from the Daily Budget was the only young man who ever came to our house.",
        "There were times when I envied Emily, our little servant, who \u2018walked out\u2019 whenever occasion offered with a",
        "large sailor to whom she was affianced.",
        "In between times, to \u2018keep her hand in\u2019, as she expressed it, she walked out with the greengrocer\u2019s",
        "young man, and the chemist\u2019s assistant.",
        "I reflected sadly that I had no one to \u2018keep my hand in\u2019 with.",
        "All Papa\u2019s friends were aged Professors\u2013usually with long beards.",
        "It is true that Professor Peterson once clasped me affectionately and said I had a \u2018neat little waist\u2019",
        "and then tried to kiss me.",
        "The phrase alone dated him hopelessly.",
        "No self-respecting female has had a \u2018neat little waist\u2019 since I was in my cradle.",
        "I yearned for adventure, for love, for romance, and I seemed condemned to an existence of drab utility.",
        "The village possessed a lending library, full of tattered works of fiction, and I enjoyed perils and love-making",

        "Our principal reason for settling in Little Hampsley had been the neighbourhood of Hampsley Cavern, a buried cave",

        "No, there had not been love between us, but we had belonged together, and I had looked after",
        "him, and had secretly admired his learning and his uncompromising devotion to science.",
        "And it hurt me that Papa should have died just when the interest of life was at its",
        "height for him.",
        "I should have felt happier if I could have buried him in a cave, with paintings of reindeer",
        "and flint implements, but the force of public opinion constrained a neat tomb",
        "with marble slab",
        "in our hideous local churchyard.",
        "The vicar\u2019s consolations, though well meant, did not console me in the least.",

        "I was very much astonished.",
        "The doctor was nearer forty than thirty and a round, tubby little man.",
        "He was not at all like the hero of \u2018The Perils of Pamela\u2019, and even less like the",
        "stern and silent Rhodesian.",
        "I reflected a minute and then asked why he wanted to marry me.",
        "That seemed to fluster him a good deal, and he murmured that a wife was a great help",
        "to a general practitioner.",
        "The position seemed even more unromantic than before, and yet something in me urged towards its acceptance.",
        "Safety, that was what I was being offered.",

        "I replied, without the least hesitation. \u2018Miss Anne, you are very much a child still.",
        "You don\u2019t understand\u2013\u2019 \u2018The practical difficulties?",
        "Yes, I do, doctor.",

        "have another proposal to make.",
        "An aunt of mine who lives in Wales is in want of a young lady to help her.",
        "How would that suit you?\u2019 \u2018No, doctor, I\u2019m going to London.",
        "If things happen anywhere, they happen in London.",
        "I shall keep my eyes open and, you\u2019ll see, something will turn up!",
        "You\u2019ll hear of me next in China or Timbuctoo.\u2019 My next visitor was Mr Flemming, Papa\u2019s London solicitor.",
        "He came down specially from town to see me.",
        "An ardent anthropologist himself, he was a great admirer of Papa\u2019s work.",
        "He was a tall, spare man with a thin face and grey hair.",
        "He rose to meet me as I entered the room and taking both my hands in his, patted",
        "them affectionately. \u2018My poor child,\u2019 he said. \u2018My poor, poor child.\u2019 Without conscious hypocrisy, I found myself assuming",
        "the demeanour of a bereaved orphan.",
        "He hypnotized me into it.",
        "He was benignant, kind and fatherly\u2013and without the least doubt he regarded me as a perfect fool of",
        "a girl left adrift to face an unkind world.",
        "From the first I felt that it was quite useless to try to convince him of the contrary.",
        "As things turned out, perhaps it was just as well I didn\u2019t. \u2018My dear child, do you think",
        "you can listen to me whilst I try to make a few things clear to you?\u2019 \u2018Oh, yes.\u2019",
        "\u2018Your father, as you know, was a very great man.",
        "Posterity will appreciate him.",
        "But he was not a good man of business.\u2019 I knew that quite as well, if not better",
        "than Mr Flemming, but I restrained myself from saying so.",
        "He continued: \u2018I do not suppose you understand much of these matters.",
        "I will try to explain as clearly as I can.\u2019 He explained at unnecessary length.",
        "The upshot seemed to be that I was left to face life with the sum of \u00a387 17",
        "s . 4 d .",
        "It seemed a strangely unsatisfying amount.",
        "I waited in some trepidation for what was coming next.",
        "I feared that Mr Flemming would be sure to have an aunt in Scotland who was in want",
        "of a bright young companion.",
        "Apparently, however, he hadn\u2019t. \u2018The question is,\u2019 he went on, \u2018the future.",
        "I understand you have no living relatives?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m alone in the world,\u2019 I said, and was struck anew",
        "by my likeness to a film heroine. \u2018You have friends?\u2019 \u2018Everyone has been very kind to me,\u2019 I",
        "said gratefully. \u2018Who would not be kind to one so young and charming?\u2019 said Mr Flemming gallantly. \u2018Well,",
        "well, my dear, we must see what can be done.\u2019 He hesitated a minute, and then said: \u2018Supposing\u2013how",
        "would it be if you came to us for a time?\u2019 I jumped at the chance.",
        "London!",
        "The place for things to happen. \u2018It\u2019s awfully kind of you,\u2019 I said. \u2018Might I really?",
        "Just while I\u2019m looking around.",
        "I must start out to earn my living, you know?\u2019 \u2018Yes, yes, my dear child.",
        "I quite understand.",
        "We will look round for something\u2013suitable.\u2019 I felt instictively that Mr Flemming\u2019s ideas of \u2018something suitable\u2019 and mine",
        "were likely to be widely divergent, but it was certainly not the moment to air my views. \u2018That",
        "is settled then.",
        "Why not return with me today?\u2019 \u2018Oh, thank you, but will Mrs Flemming\u2013\u2019 \u2018My wife will be delighted",
        "to welcome you.\u2019 I wonder if husbands know as much about their wives as they think they do.",
        "If I had a husband, I should hate him to bring home orphans without consulting me first. \u2018We",
        "will send her a wire from the station,\u2019 continued the lawyer.",
        "My few personal belongings were soon packed.",
        "I contemplated my hat sadly before putting it on.",
        "It had originally been what I call a \u2018Mary\u2019 hat, meaning by that the kind of hat a",
        "housemaid ought to wear on her day out\u2013but doesn\u2019t!",
        "A limp thing of black straw with a suitably depressed brim.",
        "With the inspiration of genius, I had kicked it once, punched it twice, dented in the crown and",
        "affixed to it a thing like a cubist\u2019s dream of a jazz carrot.",
        "The result had been distinctly chic.",
        "The carrot I had already removed, of course, and now I proceeded to undo the rest of my",
        "handiwork.",
        "The \u2018Mary\u2019 hat resumed its former status with an additional battered appearance which made it even more depressing",
        "than formerly.",
        "I might as well look as much like the popular conception of an orphan as possible.",
        "I was just a shade nervous of Mrs Flemming\u2019s reception, but hoped my appearance might have a sufficiently",
        "disarming effect.",
        "Mr Flemming was nervous too.",
        "I realized that as we went up the stairs of the tall house in a quiet Kensington square.",
        "Mrs Flemming greeted me pleasantly enough.",
        "She was a stout, placid woman of the \u2018good wife and mother\u2019 type.",
        "She took me up to a spotless chintz-hung bedroom, hoped I had everything I wanted, informed me that",
        "tea would be ready in about a quarter of an hour, and left me to my own devices.",
        "I heard her voice slightly raised, as she entered the drawing-room below on the first floor. \u2018Well, Henry,",
        "why on earth\u2013\u2019 I lost the rest, but the acerbity of the tone was evident.",
        "And a few minutes later another phrase floated up to me, in an even more acid voice: \u2018I",
        "agree with you!",
        "She is certainly very good-looking.\u2019 It is really a very hard life.",
        "Men will not be nice to you if you are not good-looking, and women will not be nice",
        "to you if you are.",
        "With a deep sigh I proceeded to do things with my hair.",
        "I have nice hair.",
        "It is black\u2013a real black, not dark brown\u2013and it grows well back from my forehead and down over",
        "the ears.",
        "With a ruthless hand I dragged it upwards.",
        "As ears, my ears are quite all right, but there is no doubt about it, ears are d\u00e9mod\u00e9",
        "nowadays.",
        "They are quite like the \u2018Queen of Spain\u2019s legs\u2019 in Professor Peterson\u2019s young day.",
        "When I had finished I looked almost unbelievably like the kind of orphan that walks out in a",
        "queue with a little bonnet and red cloak.",
        "I noticed when I went down that Mrs Flemming\u2019s eyes rested on my exposed ears with quite a",
        "kindly glance.",
        "Mr Flemming seemed puzzled.",
        "I had no doubt that he was saying to himself, \u2018What has the child done to herself?\u2019 On",
        "the whole the rest of the day passed off well.",
        "It was settled that I was to start at once to look for something to do.",
        "When I went to bed, I stared earnestly at my face in the glass.",
        "Was I really good-looking?",
        "Honestly I couldn\u2019t say I thought so!",
        "I hadn\u2019t got a straight Grecian nose, or a rosebud mouth, or any of the things you ought",
        "to have.",
        "It is true that a curate once told me that my eyes were like \u2018imprisoned sunshine in a",
        "dark, dark wood\u2019\u2013but curates always know so many quotations, and fire them off at random.",
        "I\u2019d much prefer to have Irish blue eyes than dark green ones with yellow flecks!",
        "Still, green is a good colour for adventuresses.",
        "I wound a black garment tightly round me, leaving my arms and shoulders bare.",
        "Then I brushed back my hair and pulled it well down over my ears again.",
        "I put a lot of powder on my face, so that the skin seemed even whiter than usual.",
        "I fished about until I found some lip-salve, and I put oceans of it on my lips.",
        "Then I did under my eyes with burnt cork.",
        "Finally I draped a red ribbon over my bare shoulder, stuck a scarlet feather in my hair, and",
        "placed a cigarette in one corner of my mouth.",
        "The whole effect pleased me very much. \u2018Anna the Adventuress,\u2019 I said aloud, nodding at my reflection. \u2018Anna",
        "the Adventuress.",
        "Episode I, \u201cThe House in Kensington\u201d!\u2019 Girls are foolish things.",
        "Chapter 3 In the succeeding weeks I was a good deal bored.",
        "Mrs Flemming and her friends seemed to me to be supremely uninteresting.",
        "They talked for hours of themselves and their children and of the difficulties of getting good milk for",
        "the children and of what they say to the dairy when the milk wasn\u2019t good.",
        "Then they would go on to the servants, and the difficulties of getting good servants and of what",
        "they had said to the woman at the registry office and of what the woman at the registry",
        "office had said to them.",
        "They never seemed to read the papers or to care about what went on in the world.",
        "They disliked travelling\u2013everything was so different to England.",
        "The Riviera was all right, of course, because one met all one\u2019s friends there.",
        "I listened and contained myself with difficulty.",
        "Most of these women were rich.",
        "The whole wide beautiful world was theirs to wander in and they deliberately stayed in dirty dull London",
        "and talked about milkmen and servants!",
        "I think now, looking back, that I was perhaps a shade intolerant.",
        "But they were stupid\u2013stupid even at their chosen job: most of them kept the most extraordinarily inadequate and",
        "muddled housekeeping accounts.",
        "My affairs did not progress very fast.",
        "The house and furniture had been sold, and the amount realized had just covered our debts.",
        "As yet, I had not been successful in finding a post.",
        "Not that I really wanted one!",
        "I had the firm conviction that, if I went about looking for adventure, adventure would meet me half-way.",
        "It is a theory of mine that one always gets what one wants.",
        "My theory was about to be proved in practice.",
        "It was early in January\u2013the 8th, to be exact.",
        "I was returning from an unsuccessful interview with a lady who said she wanted a secretary-companion, but really",
        "seemed to require a strong charwoman who would work twelve hours a day for \u00a325 a year.",
        "Having parted with mutual veiled impolitenesses, I walked down Edgware Road",
        "the interview had taken place in a house in St John\u2019s Wood",
        ", and across Hyde Park to St George\u2019s Hospital.",
        "There I entered Hyde Park Corner Tube Station and took a ticket to Gloucester Road.",
        "Once on the platform I walked to the extreme end of it.",
        "My inquiring mind wished to satisfy itself as to whether there really were points and an opening between",
        "the two tunnels just beyond the station in the direction of Down Street.",
        "I was foolishly pleased to find I was right.",
        "There were not many people on the platform, and at the extreme end there was only myself and",
        "one man.",
        "As I passed him, I sniffed dubiously.",
        "If there is one smell I cannot bear it is that of moth-balls!",
        "This man\u2019s heavy overcoat simply reeked of them.",
        "And yet most men begin to wear their winter overcoats before January, and consequently by this time the",
        "smell ought to have worn off.",
        "The man was beyond me, standing close to the edge of the tunnel.",
        "He seemed lost in thought, and I was able to stare at him without rudeness.",
        "He was a small thin man, very brown of face, with blue light eyes and a small dark",
        "beard. \u2018Just come from abroad,\u2019 I deduced. \u2018That\u2019s why his overcoat smells so.",
        "He\u2019s come from India.",
        "Not an officer, or he wouldn\u2019t have a beard.",
        "Perhaps a tea-planter.\u2019 At this moment the man turned as though to retrace his steps along the platform.",
        "He glanced at me and then his eyes went on to something behind me, and his face changed.",
        "It was distorted by fear\u2013almost panic.",
        "He took a step backwards as though involuntarily recoiling from some danger, forgetting that he was standing on",
        "the extreme edge of the platform, and went down and over.",
        "There was a vivid flash from the rails and a crackling sound.",
        "I shrieked.",
        "People came running up.",
        "Two station officials seemed to materialize from nowhere and took command.",
        "I remained where I was, rooted to the spot by a sort of horrible fascination.",

        "interested in the methods employed for lifting the man off the live rail and back on to the",
        "platform. \u2018Let me pass, please.",
        "I am a medical man.\u2019 A tall man with a brown beard pressed past me and bent over",
        "the motionless body.",
        "As he examined it, a curious sense of unreality seemed to possess me.",
        "The thing wasn\u2019t real\u2013couldn\u2019t be.",
        "Finally, the doctor stood upright and shook his head. \u2018Dead as a door-nail.",
        "Nothing to be done.\u2019 We had all crowded nearer, and an aggrieved porter raised his voice. \u2018Now then,",
        "stand back there, will you?",
        "What\u2019s the sense in crowding round?\u2019 A sudden nausea seized me, and I turned blindly and ran up",
        "the stairs again towards the lift.",
        "I felt that it was too horrible.",
        "I must get out into the open air.",
        "The doctor who had examined the body was just ahead of me.",
        "The lift was just about to go up, another having descended, and he broke into a run.",
        "As he did so, he dropped a piece of paper.",
        "I stopped, picked it up, and ran after him.",
        "But the lift gates clanged in my face, and I was left holding the paper in my hand.",
        "By the time the second lift reached street level, there was no sign of my quarry.",
        "I hoped it was nothing important that he had lost, and for the first time I examined it.",
        "It was a plain half-sheet of notepaper with some figures and words scrawled upon it in pencil.",
        "This is a facsimile of it: On the face of it, it certainly did not appear to be",
        "of any importance.",
        "Still, I hesitated to throw it away.",
        "As I stood there holding it, I involuntarily wrinkled my nose in displeasure.",
        "Moth-balls again!",
        "I held the paper gingerly to my nose.",
        "Yes, it smelt strongly of them.",
        "But, then\u2013 I folded up the paper carefully and put it in my bag.",
        "I walked home slowly and did a good deal of thinking.",
        "I explained to Mrs Flemming that I had witnessed a nasty accident in the Tube and that I",
        "was rather upset and would go to my room and lie down.",
        "The kind woman insisted on my having a cup of tea.",
        "After that I was left to my own devices, and I proceeded to carry out a plan I",
        "had formed coming home.",
        "I wanted to know what it was that had produced that curious feeling of unreality whilst I was",
        "watching the doctor examine the body.",
        "First I lay down on the floor in the attitude of the corpse, then I laid a bolster",
        "down in my stead, and proceeded to duplicate, so far as I could remember, every motion and gesture",
        "of the doctor.",
        "When I had finished I had got what I wanted.",
        "I sat back on my heels and frowned at the opposite walls.",
        "There was a brief notice in the evening papers that a man had been killed in the Tube,",
        "and a doubt was expressed whether it was suicide or accident.",
        "That seemed to me to make my duty clear, and when Mr Flemming heard my story he quite",
        "agreed with me. \u2018Undoubtedly you will be wanted at the inquest.",
        "You say no one else was near enough to see what happened?\u2019 \u2018I had the feeling someone was",
        "coming up behind me, but I can\u2019t be sure\u2013and, anyway, they wouldn\u2019t be as near as I was.\u2019",
        "The inquest was held.",
        "Mr Flemming made all the arrangements and took me there with him.",
        "He seemed to fear that it would be a great ordeal for me, and I had to conceal",
        "from him my complete composure.",
        "The deceased had been identified as L.",
        "B.",

        "the coroner asked me. \u2018I am positive of it.",
        "Something alarmed him, and he stepped backwards blindly without thinking what he was doing.\u2019 \u2018But what could have",
        "alarmed him?\u2019 \u2018That I don\u2019t know.",
        "But there was something.",
        "He looked panic-stricken.\u2019 A stolid juryman suggested that some men were terrified of cats.",
        "The man might have seen a cat.",
        "I didn\u2019t think his suggestion a very brilliant one, but it seemed to pass muster with the jury,",
        "who were obviously impatient to get home and only too pleased at being able to give a verdict",
        "of accident as opposed to suicide. \u2018It is extraordinary to me,\u2019 said the coroner, \u2018that the doctor who",
        "first examined the body has not come forward.",
        "His name and address should have been taken at the time.",
        "It was most irregular not to do so.\u2019 I smiled to myself.",
        "I had my own theory in regard to the doctor.",
        "In pursuance of it, I determined to make a call upon Scotland Yard at an early date.",

        "The Mill House, which is the property of Sir Eustace Pedler, MP, is to be let unfurnished, and",

        "She is thought to be a foreigner, but so far has not been identified.",
        "The police are reported to have a clue.",
        "Sir Eustace Pedler, the owner of the Mill House, is wintering on the Riviera.\u2019 Chapter 4 Nobody came",
        "forward to identify the dead woman.",
        "The inquest elicited the following facts.",
        "Shortly after one o\u2019clock on January 8th, a well-dressed woman with a slight foreign accent had entered the",
        "offices of Messrs Butler and Park, house-agents, in Knightsbridge.",
        "She explained that she wanted to rent or purchase a house on the Thames within easy reach of",
        "London.",
        "The particulars of several were given to her, including those of the Mill House.",
        "She gave the name of Mrs de Castina and her address at the Ritz, but there proved to",
        "be no one of that name staying there, and the hotel people failed to identify the body.",
        "Mrs James, the wife of Sir Eustace Pedler\u2019s gardener, who acted as caretaker to the Mill House and",
        "inhabited the small lodge opening on the main road, gave evidence.",
        "About three o\u2019clock that afternoon, a lady came to see over the house.",
        "She produced an order from the house-agents, and, as was the usual custom, Mrs James gave her the",
        "keys to the house.",
        "It was situated at some distance from the lodge, and she was not in the habit of accompanying",
        "prospective tenants.",
        "A few minutes later a young man arrived.",
        "Mrs James described him as tall and broad-shouldered, with a bronzed face and light grey eyes.",
        "He was clean-shaven and was wearing a brown suit.",
        "He explained to Mrs James that he was a friend of the lady who had come to look",
        "over the house, but had stopped at the post office to send a telegram.",
        "She directed him to the house, and thought no more about the matter.",
        "Five minutes later he reappeared, handed back the keys and explained that he feared the house would not",
        "suit them.",
        "Mrs James did not see the lady, but thought that she had gone on ahead.",
        "What she did notice was that the young man seemed very much upset about something. \u2018He looked like",
        "a man who\u2019d seen a ghost.",
        "I thought he was taken ill.\u2019 On the following day another lady and gentleman came to see the",
        "property and discovered the body lying on the floor in one of the upstairs rooms.",
        "Mrs James identified it as that of the lady who had come the day before.",
        "The house-agents also recognized it as that of \u2018Mrs de Castina\u2019.",
        "The police surgeon gave it as his opinion that the woman had been dead about twenty-four hours.",
        "The Daily Budget had jumped to the conclusion that the man in the Tube had murdered the woman",
        "and afterwards committed suicide.",
        "However, as the Tube victim was dead at two o\u2019clock and the woman was alive and well at",
        "three o\u2019clock, the only logical conclusion to come to was that the two occurrences had nothing to do",
        "with each other, and that the order to view the house at Marlow found in the dead man\u2019s",
        "pocket was merely one of those coincidences which so often occur in this life.",
        "A verdict of \u2018Wilful Murder against some person or persons unknown\u2019 was returned, and the police",
        "and the Daily Budget",
        "were left to look for \u2018the man in the brown suit\u2019.",
        "Since Mrs James was positive that there was no one in the house when the lady entered it,",
        "and that nobody except the young man in question entered it until the following afternoon, it seemed only",
        "logical to conclude that he was the murderer of the unfortunate Mrs de Castina.",
        "She had been strangled with a piece of stout black cord, and had evidently been caught unawares with",
        "no time to cry out.",
        "The black silk handbag which she carried contained a well-filled notecase and some loose change, a fine lace",
        "handkerchief, unmarked, and the return half of a first-class ticket to London.",

        "The accident in the Tube, dismissed as a coincidence, faded out of the public mind.",
        "Was it a coincidence?",
        "I was not so sure.",
        "No doubt I was prejudiced\u2013the Tube incident was my own pet mystery\u2013but there certainly seemed to me to",
        "be a connexion of some kind between the two fatalities.",
        "In each there was a man with a tanned face\u2013evidently an Englishman living abroad\u2013and there were other things.",
        "It was the consideration of these other things that finally impelled me to what I considered a dashing",
        "step.",

        "My request took some time to understand, as I had inadvertently selected the department for lost umbrellas, but",
        "eventually I was ushered into a small room and presented to Detective Inspector Meadows.",
        "Inspector Meadows was a small man with a ginger head and what I considered a peculiarly irritating manner.",
        "A satellite, also in plain clothes, sat unobtrusively in a corner. \u2018Good morning,\u2019 I said nervously. \u2018Good morning.",
        "Will you take a seat?",
        "I understand you\u2019ve something to tell me that you think may be of use to us.\u2019 His tone",
        "seemed to indicate that such a thing was unlikely in the extreme.",
        "I felt my temper stirred. \u2018Of course you know about the man who was killed in the Tube?",
        "The man who had an order to view this same house at Marlow in his pocket.\u2019 \u2018Ah!\u2019 said",
        "the inspector. \u2018You are the Miss Beddingfeld who gave evidence at the inquest.",
        "Certainly the man had an order in his pocket.",
        "A lot of other people may have had too\u2013only they didn\u2019t happen to be killed.\u2019 I rallied my",
        "forces. \u2018You didn\u2019t think it odd that this man had no ticket in his pocket?\u2019 \u2018Easiest thing in",
        "the world to drop your ticket.",
        "Done it myself.\u2019 \u2018And no money.\u2019 \u2018He had some loose change in his trousers pocket.\u2019 \u2018But no notecase.\u2019",

        "papers.",
        "He probably forgot all about the accident.\u2019 \u2018In fact, inspector, you are determined to find nothing odd,\u2019 I",
        "said sweetly. \u2018Well, I\u2019m inclined to think you\u2019re a little too fond of the word, Miss Beddingfeld.",
        "Young ladies are romantic, I know\u2013fond of mysteries and such-like.",
        "But as I\u2019m a busy man\u2013\u2019 I took the hint and rose.",
        "The man in the corner raised a meek voice. \u2018Perhaps if the young lady would tell us briefly",
        "what her ideas really are on the subject, inspector?\u2019 The inspector fell in with the suggestion readily enough.",
        "\u2018Yes, come now, Miss Beddingfeld, don\u2019t be offended.",
        "You\u2019ve asked questions and hinted things.",
        "Just straight out what it is you\u2019ve got in your head.\u2019 I wavered between injured dignity and the",
        "overwhelming desire to express my theories.",
        "Injured dignity went to the wall. \u2018You said at the inquest you were positive it wasn\u2019t suicide?\u2019 \u2018Yes,",
        "I\u2019m quite certain of that.",
        "The man was frightened.",
        "What frightened him?",
        "It wasn\u2019t me.",
        "But someone might have been walking up the platform towards us\u2013someone he recognized.\u2019 \u2018You didn\u2019t see anyone?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019",
        "I admitted. \u2018I didn\u2019t turn my head.",
        "Then, as soon as the body was recovered from the line, a man pushed forward to examine it,",
        "saying he was a doctor.\u2019 \u2018Nothing unusual in that,\u2019 said the inspector dryly. \u2018But he wasn\u2019t a doctor.\u2019",
        "\u2018What?\u2019 \u2018He wasn\u2019t a doctor,\u2019 I repeated. \u2018How do you know that, Miss Beddingfeld?\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s difficult to say,",
        "exactly.",
        "I\u2019ve worked in hospitals during the war, and I\u2019ve seen doctors handle bodies.",
        "There\u2019s a sort of deft professional callousness that this man hadn\u2019t got.",
        "Besides, a doctor doesn\u2019t usually feel for the heart on the right side of the body.\u2019 \u2018He did",
        "that?\u2019 \u2018Yes, I didn\u2019t notice it specially at the time\u2013except that I felt there was something wrong.",
        "But I worked it out when I got home, and then I saw why the whole thing had",
        "looked so unhandy to me at the time.\u2019 \u2018H\u2019m,\u2019 said the inspector.",
        "He was reaching slowly for pen and paper. \u2018In running his hands over the upper part of the",
        "man\u2019s body he would have ample opportunity to take anything he wanted from the pockets.\u2019 \u2018Doesn\u2019t sound likely",
        "to me,\u2019 said the inspector. \u2018But\u2013well, can you describe him at all?\u2019 \u2018He was tall and broad-shouldered, wore",
        "a dark overcoat and black boots, a bowler hat.",
        "He had a dark pointed beard and gold-rimmed eyeglasses.\u2019 \u2018Take away the overcoat, the beard and the eyeglasses,",
        "and there wouldn\u2019t be much to know him by,\u2019 grumbled the inspector. \u2018He could alter his appearance easily",
        "enough in five minutes if he wanted to\u2013which he would do if he\u2019s the swell pickpocket you suggest.\u2019",
        "I had not intended to suggest anything of the kind.",
        "But from this moment I gave the inspector up as hopeless. \u2018Nothing more you can tell us about",
        "him?\u2019 he demanded, as I rose to depart. \u2018Yes,\u2019 I said.",
        "I seized my opportunity to fire a parting shot. \u2018His head was markedly brachycephalic.",
        "He will not find it so easy to alter that.\u2019 I observed with pleasure that Inspector Meadows\u2019s pen",
        "wavered.",
        "It was clear that he did not know how to spell brachycephalic.",
        "Chapter 5 In the first heat of indignation, I found my next step unexpectedly easy to tackle.",
        "I had had a half-formed plan in my head when I went to Scotland Yard.",
        "One to be carried out if my interview there was unsatisfactory",
        "it had been profoundly unsatisfactory .",
        "That is, if I had the nerve to go through with it.",
        "Things that one would shrink from attempting normally are easily tackled in a flush of anger.",
        "Without giving myself time to reflect, I walked straight to the house of Lord Nasby.",
        "Lord Nasby was the millionaire owner of the Daily Budget .",
        "He owned other papers\u2013several of them, but the Daily Budget was his special child.",
        "It was as the owner of the Daily Budget that he was known to every householder in the",
        "United Kingdom.",
        "Owing to the fact that an itinerary of the great man\u2019s daily proceedings had just been published, I",
        "knew exactly where to find him at this moment.",

        "I did not, of course, suppose that any young woman who chose to come and ask for him",
        "would be at once admitted to the august presence.",
        "But I had attended to that side of the matter.",
        "In the card-tray in the hall of the Flemmings\u2019 house, I had observed the card of the Marquis",
        "of Loamsley, England\u2019s most famous sporting peer.",
        "I had removed the card, cleaned it carefully with bread-crumbs, and pencilled upon it the words: \u2018Please give",
        "Miss Beddingfeld a few moments of your time.\u2019 Adventuresses must not be too scrupulous in their methods.",
        "The thing worked.",
        "A powdered footman received the card and bore it away.",
        "Presently a pale secretary appeared.",
        "I fenced with him successfully.",
        "He retired in defeat.",
        "He again reappeared and begged me to follow him.",
        "I did so.",
        "I entered a large room, a frightened-looking shorthand-typist fled past me like a visitant from the spirit-world.",
        "Then the door shut and I was face to face with Lord Nasby.",
        "A big man.",
        "Big head.",
        "Big face.",
        "Big moustache.",

        "You are his secretary?",
        "What\u2019s it all about?\u2019 \u2018To begin with,\u2019 I said with as great an appearance of coolness as I",
        "could manage, \u2018I don\u2019t know Lord Loamsley, and he certainly knows nothing about me.",
        "I took his card from the tray in the house of the people I\u2019m staying with, and I",
        "wrote those words on it myself.",
        "It was important that I should see you.\u2019 For a moment it appeared to be a toss up",
        "as to whether Lord Nasby had apoplexy or not.",
        "In the end he swallowed twice and got over it. \u2018I admire your coolness, young woman.",
        "Well, you see me!",
        "If you interest me, you will continue to see me for exactly two minutes longer.\u2019 \u2018That will be",
        "ample,\u2019 I replied. \u2018And I shall interest you.",

        "We\u2019ve got our own special man on it.\u2019 \u2018And I\u2019ve got my own special knowledge.\u2019 \u2018What you\u2019ve just",
        "told me, eh?\u2019 \u2018Oh, no, Lord Nasby.",
        "I\u2019ve still got something up my sleeve.\u2019 \u2018Oh, you have, have you?",
        "You seem a bright sort of girl.",
        "Well, what is it?\u2019 \u2018When this so-called doctor got into the lift, he dropped a piece of paper.",
        "I picked it up.",
        "It smelt of moth balls.",
        "So did the dead man.",
        "The doctor didn\u2019t.",
        "So I saw at once that the doctor must have taken it off the body.",
        "It had two words written on it and some figures.\u2019 \u2018Let\u2019s see it.\u2019 Lord Nasby stretched out a",
        "careless hand. \u2018I think not,\u2019 I said, smiling. \u2018It\u2019s my find you see.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m right.",
        "You are a bright girl.",
        "Quite right to hang on to it.",
        "No scruples about not handing it over to the police?\u2019 \u2018I went there to do so this morning.",
        "They persisted in regarding the whole thing as having nothing to do with the Marlow affair, so I",
        "thought that in the circumstances I was justified in retaining the paper.",
        "Besides, the inspector put my back up.\u2019 \u2018Short-sighted man.",
        "Well, my dear girl, here\u2019s all I can do for you.",
        "Go on working on this line of yours.",
        "If you get anything\u2013anything that\u2019s publishable\u2013send it along and you shall have your chance.",
        "There\u2019s always room for real talent on the Daily Budget .",
        "But you\u2019ve got to make good first.",
        "See?\u2019 I thanked him and apologized for my methods. \u2018Don\u2019t mention it.",
        "I rather like cheek\u2013from a pretty girl.",
        "By the way, you said two minutes and you\u2019ve been three, allowing for interruptions.",
        "For a woman, that\u2019s quite remarkable!",
        "Must be your scientific training.\u2019 I was in the street again, breathing hard as though I had been",
        "running.",
        "I found Lord Nasby rather wearing as a new acquaintance.",
        "Chapter 6 I went home with a feeling of exultation.",
        "My scheme had succeeded far better than I could possibly have hoped.",
        "Lord Nasby had been positively genial.",
        "It only now remained for me to \u2018make good\u2019, as he expressed it.",
        "Once locked in my own room, I took out my precious piece of paper and studied it attentively.",
        "Here was the clue to the mystery.",
        "To begin with, what did the figures represent?",
        "There were five of them, and a dot after the first two. \u2018Seventeen\u2013one hundred and twenty two,\u2019 I",
        "murmured.",
        "That did not seem to lead to anything.",
        "Next I added them up.",
        "That is often done in works of fiction and leads to surprising deductions. \u2018One and seven make eight",
        "and one is nine and two are eleven and two are thirteen!\u2019 Thirteen!",
        "Fateful number!",
        "Was this a warning to me to leave the whole thing alone?",
        "Very possibly.",
        "Anyway, except as a warning, it seemed to be singularly useless.",
        "I declined to believe that any conspirator would take that way of writing thirteen in real life.",
        "If he meant thirteen, he would write thirteen. \u201813\u2019\u2013like that.",
        "There was a space between the one and the two.",
        "I accordingly subtracted twenty-two from a hundred and seventy-one.",
        "The result was a hundred and fifty-nine.",
        "I did it again and made it a hundred and forty-nine.",
        "These arithmetical exercises were doubtless excellent practice, but as regarded the solution of the mystery, they seemed totally",
        "ineffectual.",
        "I left arithmetic alone, not attempting fancy division or multiplication, and went on to the words.",
        "Kilmorden Castle.",
        "That was something definite.",
        "A place.",
        "Probably the cradle of an aristocratic family. (Missing heir?",
        "Claimant to title?) Or possibly a picturesque ruin.",
        "Buried treasure?",
        "Yes, on the whole I inclined to the theory of buried treasure.",
        "Figures always go with buried treasure.",
        "One pace to the right, seven paces to the left, dig one foot, descend twenty-two steps.",
        "That sort of idea.",
        "I could work out that later.",
        "The thing was to get to Kilmorden Castle as quickly as possible.",
        "I made a strategic sally from my room, and returned laden with books of reference.",
        "Who\u2019s Who , Whitaker, a Gazetteer, a History of Scotch Ancestral Homes, and Somebody or other\u2019s British Isles.",
        "Time passed.",
        "I searched diligently, but with growing annoyance.",
        "Finally, I shut the last book with a bang.",
        "There appeared to be no such place as Kilmorden Castle.",
        "Here was an unexpected check.",
        "There must be such a place.",
        "Why should anyone invent a name like that and write it down on a piece of paper?",
        "Absurd!",
        "Another idea occurred to me.",
        "Possibly it was a castellated abomination in the suburbs with a high-sounding name invented by its owner.",
        "But if so, it was going to be extraordinarily hard to find.",
        "I sat back gloomily on my heels",
        "I always sit on the floor to do anything really important",
        "and wondered how on earth I was to set about it.",
        "Was there any other line I could follow?",
        "I reflected earnestly and then sprang to my feet delightedly.",
        "Of course!",
        "I must visit the \u2018scene of the crime\u2019.",
        "Always done by the best sleuths!",
        "And no matter how long afterwards it may be they always find something that the police have overlooked.",
        "My course was clear.",
        "I must go to Marlow.",
        "But how was I to get into the house?",
        "I discarded several adventurous methods, and plumped for stern simplicity.",
        "The house had been to let\u2013presumably was still to let.",
        "I would be a prospective tenant.",
        "I also decided on attacking the local house-agents, as having fewer houses on their books.",
        "Here, however, I reckoned without my host.",
        "A pleasant clerk produced particulars of about half a dozen desirable properties.",
        "It took me all my ingenuity to find objections to them.",
        "In the end I feared I had drawn a blank. \u2018And you\u2019ve really nothing else?\u2019 I asked, gazing",
        "pathetically into the clerk\u2019s eyes. \u2018Something right on the river, and with a fair amount of garden and",
        "a small lodge.\u2019 I added, summing up the main points of the Mill House, as I had gathered",
        "them from the papers. \u2018Well, of course, there\u2019s Sir Eustace Pedler\u2019s place,\u2019 said the man doubtfully. \u2018The Mill",
        "House, you know.\u2019 \u2018Not\u2013not where\u2013\u2019 I faltered.",
        "Really, faltering is getting to be my strong point.",
        "\u2018That\u2019s it!",
        "Where the murder took place.",
        "But perhaps you wouldn\u2019t like\u2013\u2019 \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t think I should mind,\u2019 I said with an appearance of",
        "rallying.",
        "I felt my bona fides was now quite established. \u2018And perhaps I might get it cheap\u2013in the circumstances.\u2019",
        "A master touch that, I thought. \u2018Well, it\u2019s possible.",
        "There\u2019s no pretending that it will be easy to let now\u2013servants and all that, you know.",
        "If you like the place after you\u2019ve seen it, I should advise you to make an offer.",
        "Shall I write you out an order?\u2019 \u2018If you please.\u2019 A quarter of an hour later I was",
        "at the lodge of the Mill House.",
        "In answer to my knock, the door flew open and a tall middle-aged woman literally bounced out. \u2018Nobody",
        "can go into the house, do you hear that?",
        "Fairly sick of you reporters, I am.",
        "Sir Eustace\u2019s orders are\u2013\u2019 \u2018I understood the house was to let,\u2019 I said freezingly, holding out my order.",
        "\u2018Of course, if it\u2019s already taken\u2013\u2019 \u2018Oh, I\u2019m sure I beg your pardon, miss.",
        "I\u2019ve been fairly pestered with these newspaper people.",
        "Not a minute\u2019s peace.",
        "No, the house isn\u2019t let\u2013nor likely to be now.\u2019 \u2018Are the drains wrong?\u2019 I asked in an anxious",
        "whisper. \u2018Oh, Lord, miss, the drains is all right!",
        "But surely you\u2019ve heard about that foreign lady as was done to death here?\u2019 \u2018I believe I did",
        "read something about it in the papers,\u2019 I said carelessly.",
        "My indifference piqued the good woman.",
        "If I had betrayed any interest, she would probably have closed up like an oyster.",
        "As it was she positively bridled. \u2018I should say you did, miss!",
        "It\u2019s been in all the newspapers.",
        "The Daily Budget \u2019s out still to catch the man who did it.",
        "It seems, according to them, as our police are no good at all.",
        "Well I hope they\u2019ll get him\u2013although a nice looking fellow he was and no mistake.",
        "A kind of soldierly look about him\u2013ah, well, I dare say he\u2019d been wounded in the war, and",
        "sometimes they go a bit queer aftwards; my sister\u2019s boy did.",
        "Perhaps she\u2019d used him bad\u2013they\u2019re a bad lot, those foreigners.",
        "Though she was a fine-looking woman.",
        "Stood there where you\u2019re standing now.\u2019 \u2018Was she dark or fair?\u2019 I ventured. \u2018You can\u2019t tell from these",
        "newspaper portraits.\u2019 \u2018Dark hair, and a very white face\u2013too white for nature, I thought\u2013had her lips reddened something",
        "cruel.",
        "I don\u2019t like to see it\u2013a little powder now and then is quite another thing.\u2019 We were conversing",
        "like old friends now.",
        "I put another question. \u2018Did she seem nervous or upset at all?\u2019 \u2018Not a bit.",
        "She was smiling to herself, quiet like, as though she was amused at something.",
        "That\u2019s why you could have knocked me down with a feather when, the next afternoon, those people came",
        "running out calling for the police and saying there\u2019d been murder done.",
        "I shall never get over it, and as for setting foot in that house after dark I wouldn\u2019t",
        "do it, not if it was ever so.",
        "Why, I wouldn\u2019t even stay here at the lodge, if Sir Eustace hadn\u2019t been down on his bended",
        "knees to me.\u2019 \u2018I thought Sir Eustace Pedler was at Cannes?\u2019 \u2018So he was, miss.",
        "He came back to England when he heard the news, and, as to the bended knees, that was",
        "a figure of speech, his secretary, Mr Pagett, having offered us double pay to stay on, and, as",
        "my John says, money is money nowadays.\u2019 I concurred heartily with John\u2019s by no means original remarks. \u2018The",
        "young man now,\u2019 said Mrs James, reverting suddenly to a former point in the conversation. \u2018He was upset.",
        "His eyes, light eyes, they were, I noticed them particular, was all shining.",
        "Excited, I thought.",
        "But I never dreamt of anything being wrong.",
        "Not even when he came out again looking all queer.\u2019 \u2018How long was he in the house?\u2019 \u2018Oh,",
        "not long, a matter of five minutes maybe.\u2019 \u2018How tall was he, do you think?",
        "About six foot?\u2019 \u2018I should say so maybe.\u2019 \u2018He was clean-shaven, you say?\u2019 \u2018Yes, miss\u2013not even one of",
        "these toothbrush moustaches.\u2019 \u2018Was his chin at all shiny?\u2019 I asked on a sudden impulse.",
        "Mrs James stared at me with awe. \u2018Well, now you come to mention it, miss, it was .",
        "However did you know?\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s a curious thing, but murderers often have shiny chins,\u2019 I explained wildly.",
        "Mrs James accepted the statement in all good faith. \u2018Really, now, miss.",
        "I never heard that before.\u2019 \u2018You didn\u2019t notice what kind of head he had, I suppose?\u2019 \u2018Just the",
        "ordinary kind, miss.",
        "I\u2019ll fetch you the keys, shall I?\u2019 I accepted them, and went on my way to the Mill",
        "House.",
        "My reconstructions so far I considered good.",
        "All along I had realized that the differences between the man Mrs James had described and my Tube",
        "\u2018doctor\u2019 were those of non-essentials.",
        "An overcoat, a beard, gold-rimmed eye-glasses.",
        "The \u2018doctor\u2019 had appeared middle-aged, but I remembered that he had stooped over the body like a comparatively",
        "young man.",
        "There had been a suppleness which told of young joints.",
        "The victim of the accident",
        "the Moth Ball man, as I called him to myself",
        "and the foreign woman, Mrs de Castina, or whatever her real name was, had had an assignation to",
        "meet at the Mill House.",
        "That was how I pieced the thing together.",
        "Either because they feared they were being watched or for some other reason, they chose the rather ingenious",
        "method of both getting an order to view the same house.",
        "Thus their meeting there might have the appearance of pure chance.",
        "That the Moth Ball man had suddenly caught sight of the \u2018doctor\u2019, and that the meeting was totally",
        "unexpected and alarming to him, was another fact of which I was fairly sure.",
        "What had happened next?",
        "The \u2018doctor\u2019 had removed his disguise and followed the woman to Marlow.",
        "But it was possible that had he removed it rather hastily traces of spirit-gum might still linger on",
        "his chin.",
        "Hence my question to Mrs James.",
        "Whilst occupied with my thoughts I had arrived at the low old-fashioned door of the Mill House.",
        "Unlocking it with the key, I passed inside.",
        "The hall was low and dark, the place smelt forlorn and mildewy.",
        "In spite of myself, I shivered.",
        "Did the woman who had come here \u2018smiling to herself\u2019 a few days ago feel no chill of",
        "premonition as she entered this house?",
        "I wondered.",
        "Did the smile fade from her lips, and did a nameless dread close round her heart?",
        "Or had she gone upstairs, smiling still, unconscious of the doom that was so soon to overtake her?",
        "My heart beat a little faster.",
        "Was the house really empty?",
        "Was doom waiting for me in it also?",
        "For the first time, I understood the meaning of the much-used word, \u2018atmosphere\u2019.",
        "There was an atmosphere in this house, an atmosphere of cruelty, of menace, of evil.",
        "Chapter 7 Shaking off the feelings that oppressed me, I went quickly upstairs.",
        "I had no difficulty in finding the room of the tragedy.",
        "On the day the body was discovered it had rained heavily, and large muddy boots had trampled the",
        "uncarpeted floor in every direction.",
        "I wondered if the murderer had left any footmarks the previous day.",
        "It was likely that the police would be reticent on the subject if he had, but on consideration",
        "I decided it was unlikely.",
        "The weather had been fine and dry.",
        "There was nothing of interest about the room.",
        "It was almost square with two big bay windows, plain white walls and a bare floor, the boards",
        "being stained round the edges where the carpet had ceased.",
        "I searched it carefully, but there was not so much as a pin lying about.",
        "The gifted young detective did not seem likely to discover a neglected clue.",
        "I had brought with me a pencil and notebook.",
        "There did not seem much to note, but I duly dotted down a brief sketch of the room",
        "to cover my disappointment at the failing of my quest.",
        "As I was in the act of returning the pencil to my bag, it slipped from my fingers",
        "and rolled along the floor.",
        "The Mill House was really old, and the floors were very uneven.",
        "The pencil rolled steadily, with increasing momentum, until it came to rest under one of the windows.",
        "In the recess of each window there was a broad window-seat, underneath which there was a cupboard.",
        "My pencil was lying right against the cupboard door.",
        "The cupboard was shut, but it suddenly occurred to me that if it had been open my pencil",
        "would have rolled inside.",
        "I opened the door, and my pencil immediately rolled in and sheltered modestly in the farthest corner.",
        "I retrieved it, noting as I did so that owing to lack of light and the peculiar formation",
        "of the cupboard one could not see it, but had to feel for it.",
        "Apart from my pencil the cupboard was empty, but being thorough by nature I tried the one under",
        "the opposite window.",
        "At first sight, it looked as though that also was empty, but I grubbed about perseveringly, and was",
        "rewarded by feeling my hand close on a hard paper cylinder which lay in a sort of trough,",
        "or depression, in the far corner of the cupboard.",
        "As soon as I had it in my hand, I knew what it was.",
        "A roll of Kodak films.",
        "Here was a find!",
        "I realized, of course, that these films might very well be an old roll belonging to Sir Eustace",
        "Pedler which had rolled in here and had not been found when the cupboard was emptied.",
        "But I did not think so.",
        "The red paper was far too fresh-looking.",
        "It was just as dusty as it would have been had it lain there for two or three",
        "days\u2013that is to say, since the murder.",
        "Had it been there for any length of time, it would have been thickly coated.",
        "Who had dropped it?",
        "The woman or the man?",
        "I remembered that the contents of her handbag had appeared to be intact.",
        "If it had been jerked open in the struggle and the roll of films had fallen out, surely",
        "some of the loose money would have been scattered about also?",
        "No, it was not the woman who had dropped the films.",
        "I sniffed suddenly and suspiciously.",
        "Was the smell of moth-balls becoming an obsession with me?",
        "I could swear that the roll of films smelt of it also.",
        "I held them under my nose.",
        "They had, as usual, a strong smell of their own, but apart from that I could clearly detect",
        "the odour I disliked so much.",
        "I soon found the cause.",
        "A minute thread of cloth had caught on a rough edge of the centre wood, and that shred",
        "was strongly impregnated with moth-balls.",
        "At some time or another the films had been carried in the overcoat pocket of the man who",
        "was killed in the Tube.",
        "Was it he who had dropped them here?",
        "Hardly.",
        "His movements were all accounted for.",
        "No, it was the other man, the \u2018doctor\u2019.",
        "He had taken the films when he had taken the paper.",
        "It was he who had dropped them here during his struggle with the woman.",
        "I had got my clue!",
        "I would have the roll developed, and then I would have further developments to work upon.",
        "Very elated, I left the house, returned the keys to Mrs James and made my way as quickly",
        "as possible to the station.",
        "On the way back to town, I took out my paper and studied it afresh.",
        "Suddenly the figures took on a new significance.",
        "Suppose they were a date? 17 122.",
        "The 17th of January, 1922.",
        "Surely that must be it!",
        "Idiot that I was not to have thought of it before.",
        "But in that case I must find out the whereabouts of Kilmorden Castle, for today was actually the",
        "14th.",
        "Three days.",
        "Little enough\u2013almost hopeless when one had no idea of where to look!",
        "It was too late to hand in my roll today.",
        "I had to hurry home to Kensington so as not to be late for dinner.",
        "It occurred to me that there was an easy way of verifying whether some of my conclusions were",
        "correct.",
        "I asked Mr Flemming whether there had been a camera amongst the dead man\u2019s belongings.",
        "I knew that he had taken an interest in the case and was conversant with all the details.",

        "He was positive that there had been no photographic apparatus of any kind.",
        "That was rather a set-back to my theory.",

        "The coincidence was too much for me.",
        "Exactly the amount of my legacy!",

        "For a long time I have been racking my brains as to how to get rid of him.",
        "But you cannot very well dismiss a secretary because he prefers work to play, likes getting up early",
        "in the morning, and has positively no vices.",
        "The only amusing thing about the fellow is his face.",
        "He has the face of a fourteenth-century poisoner\u2013the sort of man the Borgias got to do their odd",

        "That is what makes him so difficult to live with.",
        "Last week I had the brilliant idea of sending him off to Florence.",
        "He talked about Florence and how much he wanted to go there. \u2018My dear fellow,\u2019 I cried, \u2018You",
        "shall go tomorrow.",
        "I will pay all your expenses.\u2019 January isn\u2019t the usual time for going to Florence, but it would",

        "It has been a delightful week.",
        "I have done everything I wanted to, and nothing that I did not want to do.",
        "But when I blinked my eyes open, and perceived Pagett standing between me and the light at the",
        "unearthly hour of 9 am this morning, I realized that freedom was over. \u2018My dear fellow,\u2019 I said,",
        "\u2018has the funeral already taken place, or is it for later in the morning?\u2019 Pagett does not appreciate",
        "dry humour.",
        "He merely stared. \u2018So you know, Sir Eustace?\u2019 \u2018Know what?\u2019 I said crossly. \u2018From the expression on your",
        "face I inferred that one of your near and dear relatives was to be interred this morning.\u2019 Pagett",
        "ignored the sally as far as possible. \u2018I thought you couldn\u2019t know about this.\u2019 He tapped the telegram.",

        "the middle of the day\u2013\u2018and I thought that under the circumstances\u2013\u2019 He tapped the telegram again. \u2018What is",
        "that thing?\u2019 I asked. \u2018It\u2019s a telegram from the police at Marlow.",
        "A woman has been murdered in your house.\u2019 That aroused me in earnest. \u2018What colossal cheek,\u2019 I exclaimed.",
        "\u2018Why in my house?",

        "it is your house.\u2019 \u2018That,\u2019 I said, \u2018appears to be more my misfortune than my fault.\u2019 Guy Pagett",
        "shook his head gloomily. \u2018It will have a very unfortunate effect upon the constituency,\u2019 he remarked lugubriously.",
        "I don\u2019t see why it should have\u2013and yet I have a feeling that in such matters Pagett\u2019s instincts",
        "are always right.",
        "On the face of it, a Member of Parliament will be none the less efficient because a stray",
        "young woman comes and gets herself murdered in an empty house that belongs to him\u2013but there is no",
        "accounting for the view the respectable British public takes of a matter. \u2018She\u2019s a foreigner too, and that",
        "makes it worse,\u2019 continued Pagett gloomily.",
        "Again I believe he is right.",
        "If it is disreputable to have a woman murdered in your house, it becomes more disreputable if the",
        "woman is a foreigner.",
        "Another idea struck me. \u2018Good heavens,\u2019 I exclaimed, \u2018I hope this won\u2019t upset Caroline.\u2019 Caroline is the lady",
        "who cooks for me.",
        "Incidentally she is the wife of my gardener.",
        "What kind of a wife she makes I do not know, but she is an excellent cook.",
        "James, on the other hand, is not a good gardener\u2013but I support him in idleness and give him",

        "I listened as patiently as I could.",
        "Finally, he dropped his voice to a whisper and explained that certain documents had come to light which",
        "ought to be placed in the hands of General Smuts. \u2018I\u2019ve no doubt you\u2019re quite right,\u2019 I said,",
        "stifling a yawn. \u2018But how are we to get them to him?",
        "Our position in the matter is delicate\u2013very delicate.\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s wrong with the post?\u2019 I said cheerfully. \u2018Put a",
        "twopenny stamp on and drop \u2019em in the nearest letter-box.\u2019 He seemed quite shocked at the suggestion. \u2018My",
        "dear Pedler!",

        "such attention to their confidential documents. \u2018If you don\u2019t like the post, send one of your own young",
        "fellows.",
        "He\u2019ll enjoy the trip.\u2019 \u2018Impossible,\u2019 said Milray, wagging his head in a senile fashion. \u2018There are reasons, my",
        "dear Pedler\u2013I assure you there are reasons.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 I said rising, \u2018all this is very interesting, but I",
        "must be off\u2013\u2019 \u2018One minute, my dear Pedler, one minute, I beg of you.",
        "Now tell me, in confidence, is it not true that you intend visiting South Africa shortly yourself?",
        "You have large interests in Rhodesia, I know, and the question of Rhodesia joining in the Union is",
        "one in which you have a vital interest.\u2019 \u2018Well, I had thought of going out in about a",
        "month\u2019s time.\u2019 \u2018You couldn\u2019t possibly make it sooner?",
        "This month?",
        "This week, in fact?\u2019 \u2018I could,\u2019 I said, eyeing him with some interest. \u2018But I don\u2019t know that",
        "I particularly want to.\u2019 \u2018You would be doing the Government a great service\u2013a very great service.",
        "You would not find them\u2013er\u2013ungrateful.\u2019 \u2018Meaning, you want me to be the postman?\u2019 \u2018Exactly.",
        "Your position is an unofficial one, your journey is bona fide.",
        "Everything would be eminently satisfactory.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 I said slowly, \u2018I don\u2019t mind if I do.",
        "The one thing I am anxious to do is to get out of England again as soon as",
        "possible.\u2019 \u2018You will find the climate of South Africa delightful\u2013quite delightful.\u2019 \u2018My dear fellow, I know all about",

        "before we parted.",
        "He shook me warmly by the hand, and thanked me again effusively.",
        "I walked home reflecting on the curious by-ways of Governmental policy.",
        "It was the following evening that Jarvis, my butler, informed me that a gentleman wished to see me",
        "on private business, but declined to give his name.",
        "I have always a lively apprehension of insurance touts, so told Jarvis to say I could not see",

        "Jarvis returned. \u2018The gentleman asked me to tell you, Sir Eustace, that he comes to you from Mr",

        "A few minutes later I was confronting my visitor in the library.",
        "He was a well-built young fellow with a deeply tanned face.",
        "A scar ran diagonally from the corner of his eye to the jaw, disfiguring what would otherwise have",
        "been a handsome though somewhat reckless countenance. \u2018Well,\u2019 I said, \u2018what\u2019s the matter?\u2019 \u2018Mr Milray sent me to",
        "you, Sir Eustace.",
        "I am to accompany you to South Africa as your secretary.\u2019 \u2018My dear fellow,\u2019 I said, \u2018I\u2019ve got",

        "Time will show.",
        "But I can tell you this, Sir Eustace, Mr Milray would not be surprised if an attempt were",
        "made to get your secretary out of the way.",
        "Oh, you need have no fear for yourself\u2019\u2013I suppose a momentary alarm had flickered across my face\u2013\u2018you are",
        "not threatened.",
        "Your secretary out of the way, access to you would be easier.",
        "In any case, Mr Milray wishes me to accompany you.",
        "The passage-money will be our affair, of course, but you will take the necessary steps about the passport,",
        "as though you had decided that you needed the services of a second secretary.\u2019 He seemed a determined",
        "young man.",
        "We stared at each other and he stared me down. \u2018Very well,\u2019 I said feebly. \u2018You will say",
        "nothing to anyone as to my accompanying you.\u2019 \u2018Very well,\u2019 I said again.",
        "After all, perhaps it was better to have this fellow with me, but I had a premonition that",
        "I was getting into deep waters.",
        "Just when I thought I had attained peace!",
        "I stopped my visitor as he was turning to depart. \u2018It might be just as well if I",
        "knew my new secretary\u2019s name,\u2019 I observed sarcastically.",
        "He considered for a minute. \u2018Harry Rayburn seems quite a suitable name,\u2019 he observed.",

        "She had a special deck-chair, and an apparently inexhaustible supply of cushions.",
        "She changed her mind three times as to where she would like it placed.",
        "Throughout everything she remained attractive and charming.",
        "She appeared to be one of those rare people in the world who know what they want, see",
        "that they get it, and manage to do so without being offensive.",
        "I decided that if ever I recovered\u2013but of course I shouldn\u2019t\u2013it would amuse me to talk to her.",
        "We reached Madeira about midday.",
        "I was still too inert to move, but I enjoyed the picturesque-looking merchants who came on board and",
        "spread their merchandise about the decks.",
        "There were flowers too.",
        "I buried my nose in an enormous bunch of sweet wet violets and felt distinctly better.",
        "In fact, I thought I might just possibly last out the end of the voyage.",
        "When my stewardess spoke of the attractions of a little chicken broth, I only protested feebly.",
        "When it came I enjoyed it.",
        "My attractive woman had been ashore.",
        "She came back escorted by a tall, soldierly-looking man with dark hair and a bronzed face whom I",
        "had noticed striding up and down the deck earlier in the day.",
        "I put him down at once as one of the strong silent men of Rhodesia.",
        "He was about forty, with a touch of greying hair at either temple, and was easily the best-looking",
        "man on board.",
        "When the stewardess brought me up an extra rug, I asked her if she knew who my attractive",
        "woman was. \u2018That\u2019s a well-known society lady, the Hon.",
        "Mrs Clarence Blair.",
        "You must have read about her in the papers.\u2019 I nodded, looking at her with renewed interest.",
        "Mrs Blair was very well known indeed as one of the smartest women of the day.",
        "I observed, with some amusement, that she was the centre of a good deal of attention.",
        "Several people essayed to scrape acquaintance with the pleasant informality that a boat allows.",
        "I admired the polite way that Mrs Blair snubbed them.",
        "She appeared to have adopted the strong, silent man as her special cavalier, and he seemed duly sensible",
        "of the privilege accorded him.",
        "The following morning, to my surprise, after taking a few turns round the deck with her attentive companion,",
        "Mrs Blair came to a halt by my chair. \u2018Feeling better this morning?\u2019 I thanked her, and said",
        "I felt slightly more like a human being. \u2018You did look ill yesterday.",
        "Colonel Race and I decided that we should have the excitement of a funeral at sea\u2013but you\u2019ve disappointed",
        "us.\u2019 I laughed. \u2018Being up in the air has done me good.\u2019 \u2018Nothing like fresh air,\u2019 said Colonel",
        "Race, smiling. \u2018Being shut up in those stuffy cabins would kill anyone,\u2019 declared Mrs Blair, dropping into a",
        "seat by my side and dismissing her companion with a little nod. \u2018You\u2019ve got an outside one, I",
        "hope?\u2019 I shook my head. \u2018My dear girl!",
        "Why don\u2019t you change?",
        "There\u2019s plenty of room.",
        "A lot of people got off at Madeira, and the boat\u2019s very empty.",
        "Talk to the purser about it.",
        "He\u2019s a nice little boy\u2013he changed me into a beautiful cabin because I didn\u2019t care for the one",
        "I\u2019d got.",
        "You talk to him at lunch-time when you go down.\u2019 I shuddered. \u2018I couldn\u2019t move.\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t be silly.",
        "Come and take a walk now with me.\u2019 She dimpled at me encouragingly.",
        "I felt very weak on my legs at first, but as we walked briskly up and down I",
        "began to feel a brighter and better being.",
        "After a turn or two, Colonel Race joined us again. \u2018You can see the Grand Peak of Tenerife",
        "from the other side.\u2019 \u2018Can we?",
        "Can I get a photograph of it, do you think?\u2019 \u2018No\u2013but that won\u2019t deter you from snapping off",
        "at it.\u2019 Mrs Blair laughed. \u2018You are unkind.",
        "Some of my photographs are very good.\u2019 \u2018About three per cent effective, I should say.\u2019 We all went",
        "round to the other side of the deck.",
        "There, glimmering white and snowy, enveloped in a delicate rose-coloured mist, rose the glistening pinnacle.",
        "I uttered an exclamation of delight.",
        "Mrs Blair ran for her camera.",
        "Undeterred by Colonel Race\u2019s sardonic comments, she snapped vigorously: \u2018There, that\u2019s the end of the roll.",
        "Oh,\u2019 her tone changed to one of chagrin, \u2018I\u2019ve had the thing at \u201cbulb\u201d all the time.\u2019 \u2018I",
        "always like to see a child with a new toy,\u2019 murmured the Colonel. \u2018How horrid you are\u2013but I\u2019ve",
        "got another roll.\u2019 She produced it in triumph from the pocket of her sweater.",
        "A sudden roll of the boat upset her balance, and as she caught at the rail to steady",
        "herself the roll of films flashed over the side. \u2018Oh!\u2019 cried Mrs Blair, comically dismayed.",
        "She leaned over. \u2018Do you think they have gone overboard?\u2019 \u2018No, you may have been fortunate enough to",
        "brain an unlucky steward in the deck below.\u2019 A small boy who had arrived unobserved a few paces",
        "to our rear blew a deafening blast on a bugle. \u2018Lunch,\u2019 declared Mrs Blair ecstatically. \u2018I\u2019ve had nothing",
        "to eat since breakfast, except two cups of beef-tea.",
        "Lunch, Miss Beddingfeld?\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 I said waveringly. \u2018Yes, I do feel rather hungry.\u2019 \u2018Splendid.",
        "You\u2019re sitting at the purser\u2019s table, I know.",
        "Tackle him about the cabin.\u2019 I found my way down to the saloon, began to eat gingerly, and",
        "finished by consuming an enormous meal.",
        "My friend of yesterday congratulated me on my recovery.",
        "Everyone was changing cabins today, he told me, and he promised that my things should be moved to",
        "an outside one without delay.",
        "There were only four at our table.",
        "Myself, a couple of elderly ladies, and a missionary who talked a lot about \u2018our poor black brothers\u2019.",
        "I looked round at the other tables.",
        "Mrs Blair was sitting at the Captain\u2019s table.",
        "Colonel Race next to her.",
        "On the other side of the Captain was a distinguished-looking, grey-haired man.",
        "A good many people I had already noticed on deck, but there was one man who had not",
        "previously appeared.",
        "Had he done so, he could hardly have escaped my notice.",
        "He was tall and dark, and had such a peculiarly sinister type of countenance that I was quite",
        "startled.",
        "I asked the purser, with some curiosity, who he was. \u2018That man?",
        "Oh, that\u2019s Sir Eustace Pedler\u2019s secretary.",
        "Been very sea-sick, poor chap, and not appeared before.",
        "Sir Eustace has got two secretaries with him, and the sea\u2019s been too much for both of them.",
        "The other fellow hasn\u2019t turned up yet.",
        "This man\u2019s name is Pagett.\u2019 So Sir Eustace Pedler, the owner of the Mill House, was on board.",
        "Probably only a coincidence, and yet\u2013 \u2018That\u2019s Sir Eustace,\u2019 my informant continued, \u2018sitting next to the Captain.",
        "Pompous old ass.\u2019 The more I studied the secretary\u2019s face, the less I liked it.",
        "Its even pallor, the secretive, heavy-lidded eyes, the curiously flattened head\u2013it all gave a feeling of distaste, of",
        "apprehension.",
        "Leaving the saloon at the same time as he did, I was close behind him as he went",
        "up on deck.",
        "He was speaking to Sir Eustace, and I overheard a fragment or two. \u2018I\u2019ll see about the cabin",
        "at once then, shall I?",
        "It\u2019s impossible to work in yours, with all your trunks.\u2019 \u2018My dear fellow,\u2019 Sir Eustace replied. \u2018My cabin",
        "is intended a",
        "for me to sleep in, and b",
        "to attempt to dress in.",
        "I never had any intentions of allowing you to sprawl about the place making an infernal clicking with",
        "that typewriter of yours.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s just what I say, Sir Eustace, we must have somewhere to work\u2013\u2019 Here",
        "I parted company from them, and went below to see if my removal was in progress.",
        "I found my steward busy at the task. \u2018Very nice cabin, miss.",
        "On D deck.",
        "No. 13.\u2019 \u2018Oh, no!\u2019 I cried. \u2018 Not 13.\u2019 13 is the one thing I am superstitious about.",
        "It was a nice cabin too.",
        "I inspected it, wavered, but a foolish superstition prevailed.",
        "I appealed almost tearfully to the steward. \u2018Isn\u2019t there any other cabin I can have?\u2019 The steward reflected.",
        "\u2018Well, there\u2019s 17, just along the starboard side.",
        "That was empty this morning, but I rather fancy it\u2019s been allotted to someone.",
        "Still, as the gentleman\u2019s things aren\u2019t in yet, and as gentlemen aren\u2019t anything like so superstitious as ladies,",
        "I dare say he wouldn\u2019t mind changing.\u2019 I hailed the proposition gratefully, and the steward departed to obtain",
        "permission from the purser.",
        "He returned grinning. \u2018That\u2019s all right, miss.",
        "We can go along.\u2019 He led the way to 17.",
        "It was not quite as large as No. 13, but I found it eminently satisfactory. \u2018I\u2019ll fetch your",
        "things right away, miss,\u2019 said the steward.",
        "But at that moment the man with the sinister face",
        "as I had nicknamed him",
        "appeared in the doorway. \u2018Excuse me,\u2019 he said, \u2018but this cabin is reserved for the use of Sir",
        "Eustace Pedler.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s all right, sir,\u2019 explained the steward. \u2018We\u2019re fitting up No. 13 instead.\u2019 \u2018No, it was",
        "No. 17 I was to have.\u2019 \u2018No. 13 is a better cabin, sir\u2013larger.\u2019 \u2018I specially selected No. 17,",
        "and the purser said I could have it.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 I said coldly. \u2018But No. 17 has been",
        "allotted to me.\u2019 \u2018I can\u2019t agree to that.\u2019 The steward put in his oar. \u2018The other cabin\u2019s just",
        "the same, only better.\u2019 \u2018I want No. 17.\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s all this?\u2019 demanded a new voice. \u2018Steward, put my",
        "things in here.",
        "This is my cabin.\u2019 It was my neighbour at lunch, the Rev.",
        "Edward Chichester. \u2018I beg your pardon,\u2019 I said. \u2018It\u2019s my cabin.\u2019 \u2018It is allotted to Sir Eustace Pedler,\u2019",
        "said Mr Pagett.",
        "We were all getting rather heated. \u2018I\u2019m sorry to have to dispute the matter,\u2019 said Chichester with a",
        "meek smile which failed to mask his determination to get his own way.",
        "Meek men are always obstinate, I have noticed.",
        "He edged himself sideways into the doorway. \u2018You\u2019re to have No. 28 on the port side,\u2019 said the",
        "steward. \u2018A very good cabin, sir.\u2019 \u2018I am afraid that I must insist.",
        "No. 17 was the cabin promised to me.\u2019 We had come to an impasse.",
        "Each one of us was determined not to give way.",
        "Strictly speaking, I, at any rate, might have retired from the contest and eased matters by offering to",
        "accept Cabin 28.",
        "So long as I did not have 13 it was immaterial to me what other cabin I had.",
        "But my blood was up.",
        "I had not the least intention of being the first to give way.",
        "And I disliked Chichester.",
        "He had false teeth that clicked when he ate.",
        "Many men have been hated for less.",
        "We all said the same things over again.",
        "The steward assured us, even more strongly, that both the other cabins were better cabins.",
        "None of us paid any attention to him.",
        "Pagett began to lose his temper.",
        "Chichester kept his serenely.",
        "With an effort I also kept mine.",
        "And still none of us would give way an inch.",
        "A wink and a whispered word from the steward gave me my cue.",
        "I faded unobtrusively from the scene.",
        "I was lucky enough to encounter the purser almost immediately. \u2018Oh, please,\u2019 I said, \u2018you did say I",
        "could have cabin 17?",
        "And the others won\u2019t go away.",
        "Mr Chichester and Mr Pagett.",
        "You will let me have it, won\u2019t you?\u2019 I always say that there are no people like sailors",
        "for being nice to women.",
        "My little purser came to scratch splendidly.",
        "He strode to the scene, informed the disputants that No. 17 was my cabin, they could have Nos",
        "13 and 28 respectively or stay where they were\u2013whichever they chose.",
        "I permitted my eyes to tell him what a hero he was and then installed myself in my",
        "new domain.",
        "The encounter had done me worlds of good.",
        "The sea was smooth, the weather growing daily warmer.",
        "Sea-sickness was a thing of the past!",
        "I went up on deck and was initiated into the mysteries of deck-quoits.",
        "I entered my name for various sports.",
        "Tea was served on deck, and I ate heartily.",
        "After tea, I played shovel-board with some pleasant young men.",
        "They were extraordinarily nice to me.",
        "I felt that life was satisfactory and delightful.",
        "The dressing bugle came as a surprise and I hurried to my new cabin.",
        "The stewardess was awaiting me with a troubled face. \u2018There\u2019s a terrible smell in your cabin, miss.",
        "What it is, I\u2019m sure I can\u2019t think, but I doubt if you\u2019ll be able to sleep here.",
        "There\u2019s a deck cabin up on C deck.",
        "You might move into that\u2013just for the night, anyway.\u2019 The smell really was pretty bad\u2013quite nauseating.",
        "I told the stewardess I would think over the question of moving whilst I dressed.",
        "I hurried over my toilet, sniffing distastefully as I did so.",
        "What was the smell?",
        "Dead rat?",
        "No, worse than that\u2013and quite different.",
        "Yet I knew it!",
        "It was something I had smelt before.",
        "Something\u2013Ah!",
        "I had got it.",
        "Asafoetida!",
        "I had worked in a hospital dispensary during the war for a short time and had become acquainted",
        "with various nauseous drugs.",
        "Asafoetida, that was it.",
        "But how\u2013 I sank down on the sofa, suddenly realizing the thing.",
        "Somebody had put a pinch of asafoetida in my cabin.",
        "Why?",
        "So that I should vacate it?",
        "Why were they so anxious to get me out?",
        "I thought of the scene this afternoon from a rather different point of view.",
        "What was it about Cabin 17 that made so many people anxious to get hold of it?",
        "The other two cabins were better cabins; why had both men insisted on sticking to 17? 17.",
        "How the number persisted!",
        "It was on the 17th I had sailed from Southampton.",
        "It was a 17\u2013I stopped with a sudden gasp.",
        "Quickly I unlocked my suit-case, and took my precious paper from its place of concealment in some rolled",
        "stockings. 17 1 22\u2013I had taken that for a date, the date of departure of the Kilmorden Castle .",
        "Supposing I was wrong.",
        "When I came to think of it, would anyone, writing down a date, think it necessary to put",
        "the year as well as the month?",
        "Supposing 17 meant Cabin 17? and 1?",
        "The time\u2013one o\u2019clock.",
        "Then 22 must be the date.",
        "I looked up at my little almanac.",
        "Tomorrow was the 22nd!",
        "Chapter 10 I was violently excited.",
        "I was sure that I had hit on the right trail at last.",
        "One thing was clear, I must not move out of the cabin.",
        "The asafoetida had got to be borne.",
        "I examined my facts again.",
        "Tomorrow was the 22nd, and at 1 am or 1 pm something would happen.",
        "I plumped for 1 am.",
        "It was now seven o\u2019clock.",
        "In six hours I should know.",
        "I don\u2019t know how I got through the evening.",
        "I retired to my cabin fairly early.",
        "I had told the stewardess that I had a cold in the head and didn\u2019t mind smells.",
        "She still seemed distressed, but I was firm.",
        "The evening seemed interminable.",
        "I duly retired to bed, but in view of emergencies I swathed myself in a thick flannel dressing-gown,",
        "and encased my feet in slippers.",
        "Thus attired I felt that I could spring up and take an active part in anything that happened.",
        "What did I expect to happen?",
        "I hardly knew.",
        "Vague fancies, most of them wildly improbable, flitted through my brain.",
        "But one thing I was firmly convinced of, at one o\u2019clock something would happen.",
        "At various times I heard fellow-passengers coming to bed.",
        "Fragments of conversation, laughing good-nights, floated in through the open transom.",
        "Then, silence.",
        "Most of the lights went out.",
        "There was still one in the passage outside, and there was therefore a certain amount of light in",
        "my cabin.",
        "I heard eight bells go.",
        "The hour that followed seemed the longest I had ever known.",
        "I consulted my watch surreptitiously to be sure I had not overshot the time.",
        "If my deductions were wrong, if nothing happened at one o\u2019clock, I should have made a fool of",
        "myself, and spent all the money I had in the world on a mare\u2019s nest.",
        "My heart beat painfully.",
        "Two bells went overhead.",
        "One o\u2019clock!",
        "And nothing.",
        "Wait\u2013what was that?",
        "I heard the quick light patter of feet running\u2013running along the passage.",
        "Then with the suddenness of a bombshell my cabin door burst open and a man almost fell inside.",
        "\u2018Save me,\u2019 he said hoarsely. \u2018They\u2019re after me.\u2019 It was not a moment for argument or explanation.",
        "I could hear footsteps outside.",
        "I had about forty seconds in which to act.",
        "I had sprung to my feet and was standing facing the stranger in the middle of the cabin.",
        "A cabin does not abound in hiding-places for a six-foot man.",
        "With one arm I pulled out my cabin trunk.",
        "He slipped down behind it under the bunk.",
        "I raised the lid.",
        "At the same time, with the other hand I pulled down the washbasin.",
        "A deft movement and my hair was screwed into a tiny knot on the top of my head.",
        "From the point of view of appearance it was inartistic, from another standpoint it was supremely artistic.",
        "A lady, with her hair screwed into an unbecoming knob and in the act of removing a piece",
        "of soap from her trunk with which, apparently, to wash her neck, could hardly be suspected of harbouring",
        "a fugitive.",
        "There was a knock at the door, and without waiting for me to say \u2018Come in\u2019 it was",
        "pushed open.",
        "I don\u2019t know what I expected to see.",
        "I think I had vague ideas of Mr Pagett brandishing a revolver.",
        "Or my missionary friend with a sandbag, or some other lethal weapon.",
        "But I certainly did not expect to see a night stewardess, with an inquiring face and looking the",
        "essence of respectability. \u2018I beg your pardon, miss, I thought you called out.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 I said, \u2018I didn\u2019t.\u2019",
        "\u2018I\u2019m sorry for interrupting you.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s all right,\u2019 I said. \u2018I couldn\u2019t sleep.",
        "I thought a wash would do me good.\u2019 It sounded rather as though it were a thing I",
        "never had as a general rule. \u2018I\u2019m so sorry, miss,\u2019 said the stewardess again. \u2018But there\u2019s a gentleman",
        "about who\u2019s rather drunk and we are afraid he might get into one of the ladies\u2019 cabins and",
        "frighten them.\u2019 \u2018How dreadful!\u2019 I said, looking alarmed. \u2018He won\u2019t come in here, will he?\u2019 \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t",
        "think so, miss.",
        "Ring the bell if he does.",
        "Good night.\u2019 \u2018Good night.\u2019 I opened the door and peeped down the corridor.",
        "Except for the retreating form of the stewardess, there was nobody in sight.",
        "Drunk!",
        "So that was the explanation of it.",
        "My histrionic talents had been wasted.",
        "I pulled the cabin trunk out a little farther and said: \u2018Come out at once, please,\u2019 in an",
        "acid voice.",
        "There was no answer.",
        "I peered under the bunk.",
        "My visitor lay immoveable.",
        "He seemed to be asleep.",
        "I tugged at his shoulder.",
        "He did not move. \u2018Dead drunk,\u2019 I thought vexedly. \u2018What am Ito do?\u2019 Then I saw something that",
        "made me catch my breath, a small scarlet spot on the floor.",
        "Using all my strength, I succeeded in dragging the man out into the middle of the cabin.",
        "The dead whiteness of his face showed that he had fainted.",
        "I found the cause of his fainting easily enough.",
        "He had been stabbed under the left shoulder-blade\u2013a nasty deep wound.",
        "I got his coat off and set to work to attend to it.",
        "At the sting of the cold water he stirred, then sat up. \u2018Keep still, please,\u2019 I said.",
        "He was the kind of young man who recovers his faculties very quickly.",
        "He pulled himself to his feet and stood there swaying a little. \u2018Thank you; I don\u2019t need anything",
        "done for me.\u2019 His manner was defiant, almost aggressive.",
        "Not a word of thanks\u2013of even common gratitude! \u2018That is a nasty wound.",
        "You must let me dress it.\u2019 \u2018You will do nothing of the kind.\u2019 He flung the words in",
        "my face as though I had been begging a favour of him.",
        "My temper, never placid, rose. \u2018I cannot congratulate you on your manners,\u2019 I said coldly. \u2018I can at",
        "least relieve you of my presence.\u2019 He started for the door, but reeled as he did so.",
        "With an abrupt movement I pushed him down upon the sofa. \u2018Don\u2019t be a fool,\u2019 I said unceremoniously.",
        "\u2018You don\u2019t want to go bleeding all over the ship, do you?\u2019 He seemed to see the sense",
        "of that, for he sat quietly whilst I bandaged up the wound as best I could. \u2018There,\u2019 I",
        "said, bestowing a pat on my handiwork, \u2018that will have to do for the present.",
        "Are you better-tempered now and do you feel inclined to tell me what it\u2019s all about?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m sorry",
        "that I can\u2019t satisfy your very natural curiosity.\u2019 \u2018Why not?\u2019 I said, chagrined.",
        "He smiled nastily. \u2018If you want a thing broadcast, tell a woman.",
        "Otherwise keep your mouth shut.\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t you think I could keep a secret?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t think\u2013I know.\u2019 He",
        "rose to his feet. \u2018At any rate,\u2019 I said spitefully, \u2018I shall be able to do a little",
        "broadcasting about the events of this evening.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ve no doubt you will too,\u2019 he said indifferently. \u2018How dare",
        "you!\u2019 I cried angrily.",
        "We were facing each other, glaring at each other with the ferocity of bitter enemies.",
        "For the first time, I took in the details of his appearance, the close-cropped dark head, the lean",
        "jaw, the scar on the brown cheek, the curious light grey eyes that looked into mine with a",
        "sort of reckless mockery hard to describe.",
        "There was something dangerous about him. \u2018You haven\u2019t thanked me yet for saving your life!\u2019 I said with",
        "false sweetness.",
        "I hit him there.",
        "I saw him flinch distinctly.",
        "Intuitively I knew that he hated above all to be reminded that he owed his life to me.",
        "I didn\u2019t care.",
        "I wanted to hurt him.",
        "I had never wanted to hurt anyone so much. \u2018I wish to God you hadn\u2019t!\u2019 he said explosively.",
        "\u2018I\u2019d be better dead and out of it.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m glad you acknowledge the debt.",
        "You can\u2019t get out of it.",
        "I saved your life and I\u2019m waiting for you to say \u201cThank you.\u201d\u2019 If looks could have killed,",
        "I think he would have liked to kill me then.",
        "He pushed roughly past me.",
        "At the door he turned back, and spoke over his shoulder. \u2018I shall not thank you\u2013now or at",
        "any other time.",
        "But I acknowledge the debt.",
        "Some day I will pay it.\u2019 He was gone, leaving me with clenched hands, and my heart beating",
        "like a mill race.",
        "Chapter 11 There were no further excitements that night.",
        "I had breakfast in bed and got up late the next morning.",
        "Mrs Blair hailed me as I came on deck. \u2018Good morning, gipsy girl.",
        "Sit down here by me.",
        "You look as though you hadn\u2019t slept well.\u2019 \u2018Why do you call me that?\u2019 I asked, as I",
        "sat down obediently. \u2018Do you mind?",
        "It suits you somehow.",
        "I\u2019ve called you that in my own mind from the beginning.",
        "It\u2019s the gipsy element in you that makes you so different from anyone else.",
        "I decided in my own mind that you and Colonel Race were the only two people on board",
        "who wouldn\u2019t bore me to death to talk to.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s funny,\u2019 I said. \u2018I thought the same about",
        "you\u2013only it\u2019s more understandable in your case.",
        "You\u2019re\u2013you\u2019re such an exquisitely finished product.\u2019 \u2018Not badly put,\u2019 said Mrs Blair, nodding her head. \u2018Tell me about",
        "yourself, gipsy girl.",
        "Why are you going to South Africa?\u2019 I told her something about Papa\u2019s life work. \u2018So you\u2019re Charles",
        "Beddingfeld\u2019s daughter?",
        "I thought you weren\u2019t a mere provincial miss!",
        "Are you going to Broken Hill to grub up more skulls?\u2019 \u2018I may,\u2019 I said cautiously. \u2018I\u2019ve got",
        "other plans as well.\u2019 \u2018What a mysterious minx you are.",
        "But you do look tired this morning.",
        "Didn\u2019t you sleep well?",
        "I can\u2019t keep awake on board a boat.",
        "Ten hours\u2019 sleep for a fool, they say!",
        "I could do with twenty!\u2019 She yawned, looking like a sleepy kitten. \u2018An idiot of a steward woke",
        "me up in the middle of the night to return me that roll of films I dropped yesterday.",
        "He did it in the most melodramatic manner, stuck his arm through the ventilator and dropped them neatly",
        "in the middle of my tummy.",
        "I thought it was a bomb for a moment!\u2019 \u2018Here\u2019s your Colonel,\u2019 I said, as the tall soldierly",
        "figure of Colonel Race appeared on the deck. \u2018He\u2019s not my Colonel particularly.",
        "In fact he admires you very much, gipsy girl.",
        "So don\u2019t run away.\u2019 \u2018I want to tie something round my head.",
        "It will be more comfortable than a hat.\u2019 I slipped quickly away.",
        "For some reason or other I was uncomfortable with Colonel Race.",
        "He was one of the few people who were capable of making me feel shy.",
        "I went down to my cabin and began looking for something with which I could restrain my rebellious",
        "locks.",
        "Now I am a tidy person, I like my things always arranged in a certain way and I",
        "keep them so.",
        "I had no sooner opened my drawer than I realized that somebody had been disarranging my things.",
        "Everything had been turned over and scattered.",
        "I looked in the other drawers and the small hanging cupboard.",
        "They told the same tale.",
        "It was as though someone had been making a hurried and ineffectual search for something.",
        "I sat down on the edge of the bunk with a grave face.",
        "Who had been searching my cabin and what had they been looking for?",
        "Was it the half-sheet of paper with scribbled figures and words?",
        "I shook my head, dissatisfied.",
        "Surely that was past history now.",
        "But what else could there be?",
        "I wanted to think.",
        "The events of last night, though exciting, had not really done anything to elucidate matters.",
        "Who was the young man who had burst into my cabin so abruptly?",
        "I had not seen him on board previously, either on deck or in the saloon.",
        "Was he one of the ship\u2019s company or was he a passenger?",
        "Who had stabbed him?",
        "Why had they stabbed him?",
        "And why, in the name of goodness, should Cabin No 17 figure so prominently?",
        "It was all a mystery, but there was no doubt that some very peculiar occurrences were taking place",
        "on the Kilmorden Castle .",
        "I counted off on my fingers the people on whom it behoved me to keep watch.",
        "Setting aside my visitor of the night before, but promising myself that I would discover him on board",
        "before another day had passed, I selected the following persons as worthy of my notice: 1",
        "Sir Eustace Pedler.",
        "He was the owner of the Mill House, and his presence on the Kilmorden Castle seemed something of",
        "a coincidence. 2",
        "Mr Pagett, the sinister-looking secretary, whose eagerness to obtain Cabin 17 had been so very marked.",
        "N.B.\u2013Find out whether he had accompanied Sir Eustace to Cannes. 3",
        "The Rev.",
        "Edward Chichester.",
        "All I had against him was his obstinacy over Cabin 17, and that might be entirely due to",
        "his own peculiar temperament.",
        "Obstinacy can be an amazing thing.",
        "But a little conversation with Mr Chichester would not come amiss, I decided.",
        "Hastily tying a handkerchief round my hair, I went up on deck again, full of purpose.",
        "I was in luck.",
        "My quarry was leaning against the rail, drinking beef tea.",
        "I went up to him. \u2018I hope you\u2019ve forgiven me over Cabin 17,\u2019 I said, with my best",
        "smile. \u2018I consider it unchristian to bear a grudge,\u2019 said Mr Chichester coldly. \u2018But the purser had distinctly",
        "promised me that cabin.\u2019 \u2018Pursers are such busy men, aren\u2019t they?\u2019 I said vaguely. \u2018I suppose they\u2019re bound",
        "to forget sometimes.\u2019 Mr Chichester did not reply. \u2018Is this your first visit to South Africa?\u2019 I inquired",
        "conversationally. \u2018To South Africa, yes.",
        "But I have worked for the last two years amongst the cannibal tribes in the interior of East",
        "Africa.\u2019 \u2018How thrilling!",
        "Have you had many narrow escapes?\u2019 \u2018Escapes?\u2019 \u2018Of being eaten, I mean?\u2019 \u2018You should not treat sacred subjects",
        "with levity, Miss Beddingfeld.\u2019 \u2018I didn\u2019t know that cannibalism was a sacred subject,\u2019 I retorted, stung.",
        "As the words left my lips, another idea struck me.",
        "If Mr Chichester had indeed spent the last two years in the interior of Africa, how was it",
        "that he was not more sun-burnt?",
        "His skin was as pink and white as a baby\u2019s.",
        "Surely there was something fishy there?",
        "Yet his manner and voice were so absolutely it .",
        "Too much so, perhaps.",
        "Was he\u2013or was he not\u2013just a little like a stage clergyman?",
        "I cast my mind back to the curates I had known at Little Hampsley.",
        "Some of them I had liked, some of them I had not, but certainly none of them had",
        "been quite like Mr Chichester.",
        "They had been human\u2013he was a glorified type.",
        "I was debating all this when Sir Eustace Pedler passed down the deck.",
        "Just as he was abreast of Mr Chichester, he stooped and picked up a piece of paper which",
        "he handed to him, remarking, \u2018You\u2019ve dropped something.\u2019 He passed on without stopping, and so probably did not",
        "notice Mr Chichester\u2019s agitation.",
        "I did.",
        "Whatever it was he had dropped, its recovery agitated him considerably.",
        "He turned a sickly green, and crumpled up the sheet of paper into a ball.",
        "My suspicions were accentuated a hundredfold.",
        "He caught my eye, and hurried into explanations. \u2018A\u2013a\u2013fragment of a sermon I was composing,\u2019 he said with",
        "a sickly smile. \u2018Indeed?\u2019 I rejoined politely.",
        "A fragment of a sermon, indeed!",
        "No, Mr Chichester\u2013too weak for words!",
        "He soon left me with a muttered excuse.",
        "I wished, oh, how I wished, that I had been the one to pick up that paper and",
        "not Sir Eustace Pedler!",
        "One thing was clear, Mr Chichester could not be exempted from my list of suspects.",
        "I was inclined to put him top of the three.",
        "After lunch, when I came up to the lounge for coffee, I noticed Sir Eustace and Pagett sitting",
        "with Mrs Blair and Colonel Race.",
        "Mrs Blair welcomed me with a smile, so I went over and joined them.",
        "They were talking about Italy. \u2018But it is misleading,\u2019 Mrs Blair insisted. \u2018 Aqua calda certainly ought to",
        "be cold water\u2013not hot.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019re not a Latin scholar,\u2019 said Sir Eustace, smiling. \u2018Men are so superior about",
        "their Latin,\u2019 said Mrs Blair. \u2018But all the same I notice that when you ask them to translate",
        "inscriptions in old churches they can never do it!",
        "They hem and haw, and get out of it somehow.\u2019 \u2018Quite right,\u2019 said Colonel Race. \u2018I always do.\u2019",
        "\u2018But I love the Italians,\u2019 continued Mrs Blair. \u2018They\u2019re so obliging\u2013though even that has its embarrassing side.",
        "You ask them the way somewhere, and instead of saying \u201cfirst to the right, second to the left\u201d",
        "or something that one could follow, they pour out a flood of well-meaning directions, and when you look",
        "bewildered they take you kindly by the arm and walk all the way there with you.\u2019 \u2018Is that",
        "your experience in Florence, Pagett?\u2019 asked Sir Eustace, turning with a smile to his secretary.",
        "For some reason the question seemed to disconcert Mr Pagett.",
        "He stammered and flushed. \u2018Oh, quite so, yes\u2013er quite so.\u2019 Then with a murmured excuse, he rose and",
        "left the table. \u2018I am beginning to suspect Guy Pagett of having committed some dark deed in Florence,\u2019",
        "remarked Sir Eustace, gazing after his secretary\u2019s retreating figure. \u2018Whenever Florence or Italy is mentioned, he changes the",
        "subject or bolts precipitately.\u2019 \u2018Perhaps he murdered someone there,\u2019 said Mrs Blair hopefully. \u2018He looks\u2013I hope I\u2019m not",
        "hurting your feelings, Sir Eustace\u2013but he does look as though he might murder someone.\u2019 \u2018Yes, pure Cinquecento!",
        "It amuses me sometimes\u2013especially when one knows as well as I do how essentially law-abiding and respectable the",
        "poor fellow really is.\u2019 \u2018He\u2019s been with you some time, hasn\u2019t he, Sir Eustace?\u2019 asked Colonel Race. \u2018Six",
        "years,\u2019 said Sir Eustace with a deep sigh. \u2018He must be quite invaluable to you,\u2019 said Mrs Blair.",
        "\u2018Oh, invaluable!",
        "Yes, quite invaluable.\u2019 The poor man sounded even more depressed, as though the invaluableness of Mr Pagett was",
        "a secret grief to him.",
        "Then he added more briskly: \u2018But his face should really inspire you with confidence, my dear lady.",
        "No self-respecting murderer would ever consent to look like one.",
        "Crippen, now, I believe, was one of the pleasantest fellows imaginable.\u2019 \u2018He was caught on a liner, wasn\u2019t",
        "he?\u2019 murmured Mrs Blair.",
        "There was a slight rattle behind us.",
        "I turned quickly.",
        "Mr Chichester had dropped his coffee-cup.",
        "Our party soon broke up; Mrs Blair went below to sleep and I went out on deck.",
        "Colonel Race followed me. \u2018You\u2019re very elusive, Miss Beddingfeld.",
        "I looked for you everywhere last night at the dance.\u2019 \u2018I went to bed early,\u2019 I explained. \u2018Are",
        "you going to run away tonight too?",
        "Or are you going to dance with me?\u2019 \u2018I shall be very pleased to dance with you,\u2019 I",
        "murmured shyly. \u2018But Mrs Blair\u2013\u2019 \u2018Our friend, Mrs Blair, doesn\u2019t care for dancing.\u2019 \u2018And do you?\u2019 \u2018I care",
        "for dancing with you.\u2019 \u2018Oh!\u2019 I said nervously.",
        "I was a little afraid of Colonel Race.",
        "Nevertheless I was enjoying myself.",
        "This was better than discussing fossilized skulls with stuffy old professors!",
        "Colonel Race was really just my ideal of a stern silent Rhodesian.",
        "Possibly I might marry him!",
        "I hadn\u2019t been asked, it is true, but, as the Boy Scouts say, Be Prepared!",
        "And all women, without in the least meaning it, consider every man they meet as a possible husband",
        "for themselves or their best friend.",
        "I danced several times with him that evening.",
        "He danced well.",
        "When the dancing was over, and I was thinking of going to bed, he suggested a turn round",
        "the deck.",
        "We walked round three times and finally subsided into two deck-chairs.",
        "There was nobody else in sight.",
        "We made desultory conversation for some time. \u2018Do you know, Miss Beddingfeld, I think I once met your",
        "father?",
        "A very interesting man\u2013on his own subject, and it\u2019s a subject that has a special fascination for me.",
        "In my humble way, I\u2019ve done a bit in that line myself.",
        "Why, when I was in the Dordogne region\u2013\u2019 Our talk became technical.",
        "Colonel Race\u2019s boast was not an idle one.",
        "He knew a great deal.",
        "At the same time, he made one or two curious mistakes\u2013slips of the tongue, I might almost have",
        "thought them.",
        "But he was quick to take his cue from me and to cover them up.",
        "Once he spoke of the Mousterian period as succeeding the Aurignacian\u2013an absurd mistake for one who knew anything",
        "of the subject.",
        "It was twelve o\u2019clock when I went to my cabin.",
        "I was still puzzling over those queer discrepancies.",
        "Was it possible that he had \u2018got the whole subject up\u2019 for the occasion\u2013that really he knew nothing",
        "of archaeology?",
        "I shook my head, vaguely dissatisfied with that solution.",
        "Just as I was dropping off to sleep, I sat up with a sudden start as another idea",
        "flashed into my head.",
        "Had he been pumping me ?",
        "Were those slight inaccuracies just tests\u2013to see whether I really knew what I was talking about?",
        "In other words, he suspected me of not being genuinely Anne Beddingfeld.",
        "Why?",
        "Chapter 12",
        "Extract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler",
        "There is something to be said for life on board ship.",
        "It is peaceful.",
        "My grey hairs fortunately exempt me from the indignities of bobbing for apples, running up and down deck",
        "with potatoes and eggs, and the more painful sports of \u2018Brother Bill\u2019 and Bolster Bar.",

        "yawn, \u2018for that matter, no more would you, my dear Pagett.\u2019 He gave me a reproachful look. \u2018You",
        "told me to get Cabin 17.\u2019 There is a touch of the \u2018boy upon the burning deck\u2019 about",

        "But I didn\u2019t mean you to make a stand to the death about it\u201313 or 28 would have",
        "done us equally well.\u2019 He looked hurt. \u2018There\u2019s something more, though,\u2019 he insisted. \u2018Miss Beddingfeld got the cabin,",
        "but this morning I saw Chichester coming out of it in a furtive sort of way.\u2019 I looked",
        "at him severely. \u2018If you\u2019re trying to get up a nasty scandal about Chichester, who is a missionary\u2013though",
        "a perfectly poisonous person\u2013and that attractive child, Anne Beddingfeld, I don\u2019t believe a word of it,\u2019 I said",

        "you will not go in fancy dress?\u2019 said Pagett, in tones of horror.",
        "I could see that it was quite incompatible with his idea of my dignity.",
        "He looked shocked and pained.",
        "I had really had no intention of donning fancy dress, but the complete discomfiture of Pagett was too",
        "tempting to be forborne. \u2018What do you mean?\u2019 I said. \u2018Of course I shall wear fancy dress.",
        "So will you.\u2019 Pagett shuddered. \u2018So go down to the barber\u2019s and see about it,\u2019 I finished. \u2018I",
        "don\u2019t think he\u2019ll have any out sizes,\u2019 murmured Pagett, measuring my figure with his eye.",
        "Without meaning it, Pagett can occasionally be extremely offensive. \u2018And order a table for six in the saloon,\u2019",

        "Blair, without Colonel Race,\u2019 Pagett interposed. \u2018He\u2019s asked her to dine with him, I know.\u2019 Pagett always knows",
        "everything.",
        "I was justifiably annoyed. \u2018Who is Race?\u2019 I demanded, exasperated.",
        "As I said before, Pagett always knows everything\u2013or thinks he does.",
        "He looked mysterious again. \u2018They say he\u2019s a Secret Service chap, Sir Eustace.",
        "Rather a great gun too.",
        "But of course I don\u2019t know for certain.\u2019 \u2018Isn\u2019t that like the Government?\u2019 I exclaimed. \u2018Here\u2019s a man",
        "on board whose business it is to carry about secret documents, and they go giving them to a",
        "peaceful outsider, who only asks to be let alone.\u2019 Pagett looked even more mysterious.",
        "He came a pace nearer and dropped his voice. \u2018If you ask me, the whole thing is very",
        "queer, Sir Eustace.",
        "Look at the illness of mine before we started\u2013\u2019 \u2018My dear fellow,\u2019 I interrupted brutally, \u2018that was a",
        "bilious attack.",
        "You\u2019re always having bilious attacks.\u2019 Pagett winced slightly. \u2018It wasn\u2019t the usual sort of bilious attack.",
        "This time\u2013\u2019 \u2018For God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t go into details of your condition, Pagett.",
        "I don\u2019t want to hear them.\u2019 \u2018Very well, Sir Eustace.",
        "But my belief is that I was deliberately poisoned!\u2019 \u2018Ah!\u2019 I said. \u2018You\u2019ve been talking to Rayburn.\u2019 He",
        "did not deny it. \u2018At any rate, Sir Eustace, he thinks so\u2013and he should be in a position",
        "to know.\u2019 \u2018By the way, where is the chap?\u2019 I asked. \u2018I\u2019ve not set eyes on him since",
        "we came on board.\u2019 \u2018He gives out that he\u2019s ill, and stays in his cabin, Sir Eustace.\u2019 Pagett\u2019s",
        "voice dropped again. \u2018But that\u2019s camouflage, I\u2019m sure.",
        "So that he can watch better.\u2019 \u2018Watch?\u2019 \u2018Over your safety, Sir Eustace.",
        "In case an attack should be made upon you.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019re such a cheerful fellow, Pagett,\u2019 I said. \u2018I",
        "trust that your imagination runs away with you.",
        "If I were you I should go to the dance as a death\u2019s head or an executioner.",
        "It will suit your mournful style of beauty.\u2019 That shut him up for the time being.",
        "I went on deck.",
        "The Beddingfeld girl was deep in conversation with the missionary parson, Chichester.",
        "Women always flutter round parsons.",
        "A man of my figure hates stooping, but I had the courtesy to pick up a bit of",
        "paper that was fluttering round the parson\u2019s feet.",
        "I got no word of thanks for my pains.",
        "As a matter of fact I couldn\u2019t help seeing what was written on the sheet of paper.",
        "There was just one sentence. \u2018Don\u2019t try to play a lone hand or it will be the worse",
        "for you.\u2019 That\u2019s a nice thing for a parson to have.",
        "Who is this fellow Chichester, I wonder?",
        "He looks mild as milk.",
        "But looks are deceptive.",
        "I shall ask Pagett about him.",
        "Pagett always knows everything.",
        "I sank gracefully into my deck-chair by the side of Mrs Blair, thereby interrupting her t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with Race,",
        "and remarked that I didn\u2019t know what the clergy were coming to nowadays.",
        "Then I asked her to dine with me on the night of the Fancy Dress dance.",
        "Somehow or other Race managed to get included in the invitation.",
        "After lunch the Beddingfeld girl came and sat with us for coffee.",
        "I was right about her legs.",
        "They are the best on the ship.",
        "I shall certainly ask her to dinner as well.",
        "I would very much like to know what mischief Pagett was up to in Florence.",
        "Whenever Italy is mentioned, he goes to pieces.",
        "If I did not know how intensely respectable he is\u2013I should suspect him of some disreputable amour\u2026 I",
        "wonder now!",
        "Even the most respectable men\u2013It would cheer me up enormously if it was so.",

        "Splendid!",
        "Chapter 13 It has been a curious evening.",
        "The only costume that fitted me in the barber\u2019s emporium was that of a Teddy Bear.",
        "I don\u2019t mind playing bears with some nice young girls on a winter\u2019s evening in England\u2013but it\u2019s hardly",
        "an ideal costume for the equator.",
        "However, I created a good deal of merriment, and won first prize for \u2018brought on board\u2019\u2013an absurd term",
        "for a costume hired for the evening.",
        "Still, as nobody seemed to have the least idea whether they were made or brought, it didn\u2019t matter.",
        "Mrs Blair refused to dress up.",
        "Apparently she is at one with Pagett on the matter.",
        "Colonel Race followed her example.",
        "Anne Beddingfeld had concocted a gipsy costume for herself, and looked extraordinarily well.",
        "Pagett said he had a headache and didn\u2019t appear.",
        "To replace him I asked a quaint little fellow called Reeves.",
        "He\u2019s a prominent member of the South African labour party.",
        "Horrible little man, but I want to keep in with him, as he gives me information that I",
        "need.",
        "I want to understand this Rand business from both sides.",
        "Dancing was a hot affair.",
        "I danced twice with Anne Beddingfeld and she had to pretend she liked it.",
        "I danced once with Mrs Blair, who didn\u2019t trouble to pretend, and I victimized various other damsels whose",
        "appearance struck me favourably.",
        "Then we went down to supper.",
        "I had ordered champagne; the steward suggested Clicquot 1911 as being the best they had on the boat",
        "and I fell in with his suggestion.",
        "I seemed to have hit on the one thing that would loosen Colonel Race\u2019s tongue.",
        "Far from being taciturn, the man became actually talkative.",
        "For a while this amused me, then it occurred to me that Colonel Race, and not myself, was",
        "becoming the life and soul of the party.",
        "He chaffed me at length about keeping a diary. \u2018It will reveal all your indiscretions one of these",
        "days, Pedler.\u2019 \u2018My dear Race,\u2019 I said, \u2018I venture to suggest that I am not quite the fool",
        "you think me.",
        "I may commit indiscretions, but I don\u2019t write them down in black and white.",
        "After my death, my executors will know my opinion of a great many people, but I doubt if",
        "they will find anything to add or detract from their opinion of me.",

        "thing as unconscious self-revelation, though.\u2019 \u2018In the eyes of the psycho-analyst, all things are vile,\u2019 I replied sententiously.",
        "\u2018You must have had a very interesting life, Colonel Race?\u2019 said Miss Beddingfeld, gazing at him with wide,",

        "That\u2019s how they do it, these girls!",
        "Othello charmed Desdemona by telling her stories, but, oh, didn\u2019t Desdemona charm Othello by the way she listened?",

        "A man who has shot lions in large quantities has an unfair advantage over other men.",
        "It seemed to me that it was time I, too, told a lion story.",
        "One of a more sprightly character. \u2018By the way,\u2019 I remarked, \u2018that reminds me of a rather exciting",
        "tale I heard.",
        "A friend of mine was out on a shooting trip somewhere in East Africa.",
        "One night he came out of his tent for some reason, and was startled by a low growl.",
        "He turned sharply and saw a lion crouching to spring.",
        "He had left his rifle in the tent.",
        "Quick as thought, he ducked, and the lion sprang right over his head.",
        "Annoyed at having missed him, the animal growled and prepared to spring again.",
        "Again he ducked, and again the lion sprang right over him.",
        "This happened a third time, but by now he was close to the entrance of his tent, and",
        "he darted in and seized his rifle.",
        "When he emerged, rifle in hand, the lion had disappeared.",
        "That puzzled him greatly.",
        "He crept round the back of the tent, where there was a little clearing.",
        "There, sure enough, was the lion, busily practising low jumps.\u2019 This was received by a roar of applause.",
        "I drank some champagne. \u2018On another occasion,\u2019 I remarked, \u2018this friend of mine had a second curious experience.",
        "He was trekking across country, and being anxious to arrive at his destination before the heat of the",
        "day he ordered his boys to inspan whilst it was still dark.",
        "They had some trouble in doing so, as the mules were very restive, but at last they managed",
        "it, and a start was made.",
        "The mules raced along like the wind, and when daylight came they saw why.",
        "In the darkness, the boys had inspanned a lion as the near wheeler.\u2019 This, too, was well received,",
        "a ripple of merriment going round the table, but I am not sure that the greatest tribute did",
        "not come from my friend the Labour Member, who remained pale and serious. \u2018My God!\u2019 he said anxiously.",
        "\u2018Who un\u2019 arnessed them?\u2019 \u2018I must go to Rhodesia,\u2019 said Mrs Blair. \u2018After what you have told us,",
        "Colonel Race, I simply must.",
        "It\u2019s a horrible journey though, five days in the train.\u2019 \u2018You must join me in my private car,\u2019",

        "Do you really mean it?\u2019 \u2018Do I mean it!\u2019 I exclaimed reproachfully, and drank another glass of champagne.",
        "\u2018Just about another week, and we shall be in South Africa,\u2019 sighed Mrs Blair. \u2018Ah, South Africa,\u2019 I",
        "said sentimentally, and began to quote from a recent speech of mine at the Colonial Institute. \u2018What has",
        "South Africa to show the world?",
        "What indeed?",
        "Her fruit and her farms, her wool and her wattles, her herds and her hides, her gold mines",
        "and her diamonds\u2013\u2019 I was hurrying on, because I knew that as soon as I paused Reeves would",
        "butt in and inform me that the hides were worthless because the animals hung themselves up on barbed",
        "wire or something of that sort, would crab everything else, and end up with the hardships of the",
        "miners on the Rand.",
        "And I was not in the mood to be abused as a Capitalist.",
        "However, the interruption came from another source at the magic word diamonds. \u2018Diamonds!\u2019 said Mrs Blair ecstatically. \u2018Diamonds!\u2019",
        "breathed Miss Beddingfeld.",
        "They both addressed Colonel Race. \u2018I suppose you\u2019ve been to Kimberley?\u2019 I had been to Kimberley too, but",

        "disappointment as though she had been journeying there for the express purpose. \u2018Nothing\u2019s impossible, Mrs Blair.",
        "Thefts do occur\u2013like the case I told you of where the Kafir hid the stone in his wound.\u2019",

        "Diamonds of small size had been found before in the neighbourhood of the Essequibo and Mazaruni rivers, but",
        "these two young men, John Eardsley and his friend Lucas, claimed to have discovered beds of great carbon",
        "deposits at the common head of two streams.",
        "The diamonds were of every colour, pink, blue, yellow, green, black, and the purest white.",
        "Eardsley and Lucas came to Kimberley, where they were to submit their gems to inspection.",
        "At the same time a sensational robbery was found to have taken place at De Beers.",
        "When sending diamonds to England they are made up into a packet.",
        "This remains in the big safe, of which the two keys are held by two different men whilst",
        "a third man knows the combination.",
        "They are handed to the Bank, and the Bank send them to England.",
        "Each package is worth, roughly, about \u00a3100,000. \u2018On this occasion the Bank were struck by something a little",
        "unusual about the sealing of the packet.",
        "It was opened, and found to contain knobs of sugar! \u2018Exactly how suspicion came to fasten on John",
        "Eardsley I do not know.",
        "It was remembered that he had been very wild at Cambridge and that his father had paid his",
        "debts more than once.",
        "Anyhow, it soon got about that this story of South American diamond fields was all a fantasy.",
        "John Eardsley was arrested.",
        "In his possession was found a portion of the De Beers diamonds. \u2018But the case never came to",
        "court.",
        "Sir Laurence Eardsley paid over a sum equal to the missing diamonds, and De Beers did not prosecute.",
        "Exactly how the robbery was committed has never been known.",

        "He had a stroke shortly afterwards.",
        "As for John, his Fate was in a way merciful.",
        "He enlisted, went to the War, fought there bravely, and was killed, thus wiping out the stain on",

        "At the little gasp she gave, I, too, turned.",
        "My new secretary, Rayburn, was standing in the doorway.",

        "But caution is useless with a woman, the more you hold back, the more she presses forward.",

        "I sat on the edge of my bunk, still in my gipsy dress, and considered the situation.",
        "I thought first of Colonel Race.",
        "He had seemed to like me.",
        "He would be kind, I was sure.",
        "And he was no fool.",
        "Yet, as I thought it over, I wavered.",

        "She, too, had been kind to me.",
        "I did not delude myself into the belief that that really meant anything.",
        "It was probably a mere whim of the moment.",

        "She was a woman who had experienced most of the ordinary sensations in life.",
        "I proposed to supply her with an extraordinary one!",

        "of affectation.",
        "My mind was made up.",
        "I decided to seek her out then and there.",

        "He apologized for the delay in answering the bell, but explained that he had all the cabins to",

        "I\u2019m not accustomed to being snubbed.",
        "It\u2019s been quite a pleasing novelty.",
        "Sit down on the sofa and unburden your soul.\u2019 I told her the whole story.",
        "It took some time as I was conscientious over all the details.",
        "She gave a deep sigh when I had finished, but she did not say at all what I",
        "had expected her to say.",
        "Instead she looked at me, laughed a little and said: \u2018Do you know, Anne, you\u2019re a very unusual",
        "girl?",
        "Haven\u2019t you ever had qualms?\u2019 \u2018Qualms?\u2019 I asked, puzzled. \u2018Yes, qualms, qualms, qualms!",
        "Starting off alone with practically no money.",
        "What will you do when you find yourself in a strange country with all your money gone?\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s",

        "Forty pounds!\u2019 \u2018Lots of money!",

        "way.",
        "I couldn\u2019t start off gaily with a few pounds in my pocket and no idea as to what",
        "I was doing and where I was going.\u2019 \u2018But that\u2019s the fun of it,\u2019 I cried, thoroughly roused.",
        "\u2018It gives one such a splendid feeling of adventure.\u2019 She looked at me, nodded once or twice, and",
        "then smiled. \u2018Lucky Anne!",
        "There aren\u2019t many people in the world who feel as you do.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 I said impatiently, \u2018what do",
        "you think of it all, Mrs Blair?\u2019 \u2018I think it\u2019s the most thrilling thing I ever heard!",
        "Now, to begin with, you will stop calling me Mrs Blair.",
        "Suzanne will be ever so much better.",
        "Is that agreed?\u2019 \u2018I should love it, Suzanne.\u2019 \u2018Good girl.",

        "stabbed and came into your cabin for shelter?\u2019 I nodded. \u2018That gives us two links connecting Sir Eustace",
        "with the tangle.",
        "The woman was murdered in his house, and it\u2019s his secretary who gets stabbed at the mystic hour",
        "of one o\u2019clock.",

        "There\u2019s a connexion somewhere even if he himself is unaware of it. \u2018Then there\u2019s the queer business of",
        "the stewardess,\u2019 she continued thoughtfully. \u2018What was she like?\u2019 \u2018I hardly noticed her.",
        "I was so excited and strung up\u2013and a stewardess seemed such an anticlimax.",
        "But\u2013yes\u2013I did think her face was familiar.",
        "Of course it would be if I\u2019d seen her about the ship.\u2019 \u2018Her face seemed familiar to you,\u2019",
        "said Suzanne. \u2018Sure she wasn\u2019t a man?\u2019 \u2018She was very tall,\u2019 I admitted. \u2018Hum.",
        "Hardly Sir Eustace, I should think, nor Mr Pagett\u2013Wait!\u2019 She caught up a scrap of paper and began",
        "drawing feverishly.",
        "She inspected the result with her head poised on one side. \u2018A very good likeness of the Rev.",
        "Edward Chichester.",
        "Now for the etceteras.\u2019 She passed the paper over to me. \u2018Is that your stewardess?\u2019 \u2018Why, yes,\u2019 I",
        "cried. \u2018Suzanne, how clever of you!\u2019 She disdained the compliment with a light gesture. \u2018I\u2019ve always had suspicions",
        "about that Chichester creature.",
        "Do you remember how he dropped his coffee-cup and turned a sickly green when we were discussing Crippen",
        "the other day?\u2019 \u2018And he tried to get Cabin 17!\u2019 \u2018Yes, it all fits in so far.",
        "But what does it all mean ?",
        "What was really meant to happen at one o\u2019clock in Cabin 17?",
        "It can\u2019t be the stabbing of the secretary.",
        "There would be no point in timing that for a special hour on a special day in a",
        "special place.",
        "No, it must have been some kind of appointment and he was on his way to keep it",
        "when they knifed him.",
        "But who was the appointment with?",
        "Certainly not with you.",
        "It might have been with Chichester.",
        "Or it might have been with Pagett.\u2019 \u2018That seems unlikely,\u2019 I objected; \u2018they can see each other any",
        "time.\u2019 We both sat silent for a minute or two, then Suzanne started off on another tack. \u2018Could",
        "there have been anything hidden in the cabin?\u2019 \u2018That seems more probable,\u2019 I agreed. \u2018It would explain my",
        "things being ransacked the next morning.",
        "But there was nothing hidden there, I\u2019m sure of it.\u2019 \u2018The young man couldn\u2019t have slipped something into",
        "a drawer the night before?\u2019 I shook my head. \u2018I should have seen him.\u2019 \u2018Could it have been",
        "your precious bit of paper they were looking for?\u2019 \u2018It might have been, but it seems rather senseless.",
        "It was only a time and a date\u2013and they were both past by then.\u2019 Suzanne nodded. \u2018That\u2019s so,",
        "of course.",
        "No, it wasn\u2019t the paper.",
        "By the way, have you got it with you?",
        "I\u2019d rather like to see it.\u2019 I had brought the paper with me as Exhibit A, and I",
        "handed it over to her.",
        "She scrutinized it, frowning. \u2018There\u2019s a dot after the 17.",
        "Why isn\u2019t there a dot after the 1 too?\u2019 \u2018There\u2019s a space,\u2019 I pointed out. \u2018Yes, there\u2019s a",
        "space, but\u2013\u2019 Suddenly she rose and peered at the paper, holding it as close under the light as",
        "possible.",
        "There was a repressed excitement in her manner. \u2018Anne, that isn\u2019t a dot!",
        "That\u2019s a flaw in the paper!",
        "A flaw in the paper, you see?",
        "So you\u2019ve got to ignore it, and just go by the spaces\u2013the spaces!\u2019 I had risen and was",
        "standing by her.",
        "I read out the figures as I now saw them. \u20181 71 22.\u2019 \u2018You see,\u2019 said Suzanne. \u2018It\u2019s",
        "the same, but not quite.",
        "It\u2019s one o\u2019clock still, and the 22nd\u2013but it\u2019s Cabin 71!",
        "My cabin, Anne!\u2019 We stood staring at each other, so pleased with our new discovery and so rapt",
        "with excitement that you might have thought we had solved the whole mystery.",
        "Then I fell to earth with a bump. \u2018But, Suzanne, nothing happened here at one o\u2019clock on the",
        "22nd?\u2019 Her face fell also. \u2018No\u2013it didn\u2019t.\u2019 Another idea struck me. \u2018This isn\u2019t your own cabin, is it,",
        "Suzanne?",
        "I mean not the one you originally booked?\u2019 \u2018No, the purser changed me into it.\u2019 \u2018I wonder if",
        "it was booked before sailing for someone\u2013someone who didn\u2019t turn up.",
        "I suppose we could find out.\u2019 \u2018We don\u2019t need to find out, gipsy girl,\u2019 cried Suzanne. \u2018I know!",
        "The purser was telling me about it.",
        "The cabin was booked in the name of Mrs Grey\u2013but it seems that Mrs Grey was merely a",
        "pseudonym for the famous Madame Nadina.",
        "She\u2019s a celebrated Russian dancer, you know.",
        "She\u2019s never appeared in London, but Paris has been quite mad about her.",
        "She had a terrific success there all through the War.",
        "A thoroughly bad lot, I believe, but most attractive.",
        "The purser expressed his regrets that she wasn\u2019t on board in a most heartfelt fashion when he gave",
        "me her cabin, and then Colonel Race told me a lot about her.",
        "It seems there were very queer stories afloat in Paris.",
        "She was suspected of espionage, but they couldn\u2019t prove anything.",
        "I rather fancy Colonel Race was over there simply on that account.",
        "He\u2019s told me some very interesting things.",
        "There was a regular organized gang, not German in origin at all.",
        "In fact the head of it, a man always referred to as \u201cthe Colonel\u201d, was thought to be",
        "an Englishman, but they never got any clue to his identity.",
        "But there is no doubt that he controlled a considerable organization of international crooks.",
        "Robberies, espionage, assaults, he undertook them all\u2013and usually provided an innocent scapegoat to pay the penalty.",
        "Diabolically clever, he must have been!",
        "This woman was supposed to be one of his agents, but they couldn\u2019t get hold of anything to",
        "go upon.",
        "Yes, Anne, we\u2019re on the right tack.",
        "Nadina is just the woman to be mixed up in this business.",
        "The appointment on the morning of the 22nd was with her in this cabin.",
        "But where is she?",
        "Why didn\u2019t she sail?\u2019 A light flashed upon me. \u2018She meant to sail,\u2019 I said slowly. \u2018Then why",
        "didn\u2019t she?\u2019 \u2018 Because she was dead .",
        "Suzanne, Nadina was the woman murdered at Marlow!\u2019 My mind went back to the bare room in the",
        "empty house and there swept over me again the indefinable sensation of menace and evil.",
        "With it came the memory of the falling pencil and the discovery of the roll of films.",
        "A roll of films\u2013that struck a more recent note.",
        "Where had I heard of a roll of films?",
        "And why did I connect that thought with Mrs Blair?",
        "Suddenly I flew at her and almost shook her in my excitement. \u2018Your films!",
        "The ones that were passed to you through the ventilator?",
        "Wasn\u2019t that on the 22nd?\u2019 \u2018The ones I lost?\u2019 \u2018How do you know they were the same?",
        "Why would anyone return them to you that way\u2013in the middle of the night?",
        "It\u2019s a mad idea.",
        "No\u2013they were a message, the films had been taken out of the yellow tin case, and something else",
        "put inside.",
        "Have you still got it?\u2019 \u2018I may have used it.",
        "No, here it is.",
        "I remember I tossed it into the rack at the side of the bunk.\u2019 She held it out",
        "to me.",
        "It was an ordinary round tin cylinder, such as films are packed in for the tropics.",
        "I took it with trembling hand, but even as I did so my heart leapt.",
        "It was noticeably heavier than it should have been.",
        "With shaking fingers I peeled off the strip of adhesive plaster that kept it air-tight.",
        "I pulled off the lid, and a stream of dull glassy pebbles rolled on to the bed. \u2018Pebbles,\u2019",
        "I said, keenly disappointed. \u2018Pebbles?\u2019 cried Suzanne.",
        "The ring in her voice excited me. \u2018Pebbles?",
        "No, Anne, not pebbles!",
        "Diamonds! \u2019 Chapter 15 Diamonds!",
        "I stared, fascinated, at the glassy heap on the bunk.",
        "I picked up one which, but for the weight, might have been a fragment of broken bottle. \u2018Are",
        "you sure, Suzanne?\u2019 \u2018Oh, yes, my dear.",
        "I\u2019ve seen rough diamonds too often to have any doubts.",
        "They\u2019re beauties too, Anne\u2013and some of them are unique, I should say.",
        "There\u2019s a history behind these.\u2019 \u2018The history we heard tonight,\u2019 I cried. \u2018You mean\u2013\u2019 \u2018Colonel Race\u2019s story.",
        "It can\u2019t be a coincidence.",
        "He told it for a purpose.\u2019 \u2018To see its effect, you mean?\u2019 I nodded. \u2018Its effect on Sir",
        "Eustace?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 But, even as I said it, a doubt assailed me.",
        "Was it Sir Eustace who had been subjected to a test, or had the story been told for",
        "my benefit?",
        "I remembered the impression I had received on that former night of having been deliberately \u2018pumped\u2019.",
        "For some reason or other, Colonel Race was suspicious.",
        "But where did he come in?",
        "What possible connexion could he have with the affair? \u2018Who is Colonel Race?\u2019 I asked. \u2018That\u2019s rather a",
        "question,\u2019 said Suzanne. \u2018He\u2019s pretty well known as a big-game hunter, and, as you heard him say tonight,",
        "he was a distant cousin of Sir Laurence Eardsley.",
        "I\u2019ve never actually met him until this trip.",
        "He journeys to and from Africa a good deal.",
        "There\u2019s a general idea that he does Secret Service work.",
        "I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s true or not.",
        "He\u2019s certainly rather a mysterious creature.\u2019 \u2018I suppose he came into a lot of money as Sir Laurence",
        "Eardsley\u2019s heir?\u2019 \u2018My dear Anne, he must be rolling .",
        "You know, he\u2019d be a splendid match for you.\u2019 \u2018I can\u2019t have a good go at him with",
        "you aboard the ship,\u2019 I said, laughing. \u2018Oh, these married women!\u2019 \u2018We do have a pull,\u2019 murmured Suzanne",
        "complacently. \u2018And everybody knows that I am absolutely devoted to Clarence\u2013my husband, you know.",
        "It\u2019s so safe and pleasant to make love to a devoted wife.\u2019 \u2018It must be very nice for",
        "Clarence to be married to someone like you.\u2019 \u2018Well, I\u2019m wearing to live with!",
        "Still, he can always escape to the Foreign Office, where he fixes his eyeglass in his eye, and",
        "goes to sleep in a big arm-chair.",
        "We might cable him to tell us all he knows about Race.",
        "I love sending cables.",
        "And they annoy Clarence so.",
        "He always says a letter would have done as well.",
        "I don\u2019t suppose he\u2019d tell us anything though.",
        "He is so frightfully discreet.",
        "That\u2019s what makes him so hard to live with for long on end.",
        "But let us go on with our matchmaking.",
        "I\u2019m sure Colonel Race is very attracted to you, Anne.",
        "Give him a couple of glances from those wicked eyes of yours, and the deed is done.",
        "Everyone gets engaged on board ship.",
        "There\u2019s nothing else to do.\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t want to get married.\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t you?\u2019 said Suzanne. \u2018Why not?",
        "I love being married\u2013even to Clarence!\u2019 I disdained her flippancy. \u2018What I want to know is,\u2019 I said",
        "with determination, \u2018what has Colonel Race got to do with this?",
        "He\u2019s in it somewhere.\u2019 \u2018You don\u2019t think it was mere chance, his telling that story?\u2019 \u2018No, I don\u2019t,\u2019",
        "I said decidedly. \u2018He was watching us all narrowly.",
        "You remember, some of the diamonds were recovered, not all.",
        "Perhaps these are the missing ones\u2013or perhaps\u2013\u2019 \u2018Perhaps what?\u2019 I did not answer directly. \u2018I should like to",
        "know,\u2019 I said, \u2018what became of the other young man.",
        "Not Eardsley but\u2013what was his name?\u2013Lucas!\u2019 \u2018We\u2019re getting some light on the thing, anyway.",
        "It\u2019s the diamonds all these people are after.",
        "It must have been to obtain possession of the diamonds that \u201cThe Man in the Brown Suit\u201d killed",
        "Nadina.\u2019 \u2018He didn\u2019t kill her,\u2019 I said sharply. \u2018Of course he killed her.",
        "Who else could have done so?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know.",
        "But I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t kill her.\u2019 \u2018He went into the house three minutes after her and came",
        "out as white as a sheet.\u2019 \u2018Because he found her dead.\u2019 \u2018But nobody else went in.\u2019 \u2018Then the",
        "murderer was in the house already, or else he got in some other way.",
        "There\u2019s no need for him to pass the lodge, he could have climbed over the wall.\u2019 Suzanne glanced",
        "at me sharply. \u2018\u201cThe Man in the Brown Suit,\u201d\u2019 she mused. \u2018Who was he, I wonder?",
        "Anyway, he was identical with the \u201cdoctor\u201d in the Tube.",
        "He would have had time to remove his makeup and follow the woman to Marlow.",
        "She and Carton were to have met there, they both had an order to view the same house,",
        "and if they took such elaborate precautions to make their meeting appear accidental they must have suspected they",
        "were being followed.",
        "All the same, Carton did not know that his shadower was the \u201cMan in the Brown Suit\u201d.",
        "When he recognized him, the shock was so great that he lost his head completely and stepped back",
        "on to the line.",
        "That all seems pretty clear, don\u2019t you think so, Anne!\u2019 I did not reply. \u2018Yes, that\u2019s how it",
        "was.",
        "He took the paper from the dead man, and in his hurry to get away he dropped it.",
        "Then he followed the woman to Marlow.",
        "What did he do when he left there, when he had killed her\u2013or, according to you, found her",
        "dead?",
        "Where did he go?\u2019 Still I said nothing. \u2018I wonder, now,\u2019 said Suzanne musingly. \u2018Is it possible that",
        "he induced Sir Eustace Pedler to bring him on board as his secretary?",
        "It would be a unique chance of getting safely out of England, and dodging the hue and cry.",
        "But how did he square Sir Eustace?",
        "It looks as though he had some hold over him.\u2019 \u2018Or over Pagett,\u2019 I suggested in spite of",
        "myself. \u2018You don\u2019t seem to like Pagett, Anne.",
        "Sir Eustace says he\u2019s a most capable and hard-working young man.",
        "And, really, he may be for all we know against him.",
        "Well, to continue my surmises, Rayburn is \u201cThe Man in the Brown Suit\u201d.",
        "He had read the paper he dropped.",
        "Therefore, misled by the dot as you were, he attempts to reach Cabin 17 at one o\u2019clock on",
        "the 22nd, having previously tried to get possession of the cabin through Pagett.",
        "On the way there somebody knifes him\u2013\u2019 \u2018Who?\u2019 I interpolated. \u2018Chichester.",
        "Yes, it all fits in.",
        "Cable to Lord Nasby that you have found \u201cThe Man in the Brown Suit\u201d, and your fortune\u2019s made,",
        "Anne!\u2019 \u2018There are several things you\u2019ve overlooked.\u2019 \u2018What things?",
        "Rayburn\u2019s got a scar, I know\u2013but a scar can be faked easily enough.",
        "He\u2019s the right height and build.",
        "What\u2019s the description of a head with which you pulverized them at Scotland Yard?\u2019 I trembled.",
        "Suzanne was a well-educated, well-read woman, but I prayed that she might not be conversant with technical terms",
        "of anthropology. \u2018Dolichocephalic,\u2019 I said lightly.",
        "Susanne looked doubtful. \u2018Was that it?\u2019 \u2018Yes.",
        "Long-headed, you know.",
        "A head whose width is less than 75 per cent of its length,\u2019 I explained fluently.",
        "There was a pause.",
        "I was just beginning to breathe freely when Suzanne said suddenly: \u2018What\u2019s the opposite?\u2019 \u2018What do you mean\u2013the",
        "opposite?\u2019 \u2018Well, there must be an opposite.",
        "What do you call heads whose breadth is more than 75 per cent of their length?\u2019 \u2018Brachycephalic,\u2019 I",
        "murmured unwillingly. \u2018That\u2019s it.",
        "I thought that was what you said.\u2019 \u2018Did I?",
        "It was a slip of the tongue.",
        "I meant dolichocephalic,\u2019 I said with all the assurance I could muster.",
        "Suzanne looked at me searchingly.",
        "Then she laughed. \u2018You lie very well, gipsy girl.",
        "But it will save time and trouble now if you tell me all about it.\u2019 \u2018There is nothing",
        "to tell,\u2019 I said unwillingly. \u2018Isn\u2019t there?\u2019 said Suzanne gently. \u2018I suppose I shall have to tell you,\u2019",
        "I said slowly. \u2018I\u2019m not ashamed of it.",
        "You can\u2019t be ashamed of something that just\u2013happens to you.",
        "That\u2019s what he did.",
        "He was detestable\u2013rude and ungrateful\u2013but that I think I understand.",
        "It\u2019s like a dog that\u2019s been chained up\u2013or badly treated\u2013it\u2019ll bite anybody.",
        "That\u2019s what he was like\u2013bitter and snarling.",
        "I don\u2019t know why I care\u2013but I do.",
        "I care horribly.",
        "Just seeing him has turned my whole life upside-down.",
        "I love him.",
        "I want him.",
        "I\u2019ll walk all over Africa barefoot till I find him, and I\u2019ll make him care for me.",
        "I\u2019d die for him.",
        "I\u2019d work for him, slave for him, steal for him, even beg or borrow for him!",
        "There\u2013now you know!\u2019 Suzanne looked at me for a long time. \u2018You\u2019re very un-English, gipsy girl,\u2019 she said",
        "at last. \u2018There\u2019s not a scrap of the sentimental about you.",
        "I\u2019ve never met anyone who was at once so practical and so passionate.",
        "I shall never care for anyone like that\u2013mercifully for me\u2013and yet\u2013and yet I envy you, gipsy girl.",
        "It\u2019s something to be able to care.",
        "Most people can\u2019t.",
        "But what a mercy for your little doctor man that you didn\u2019t marry him.",
        "He doesn\u2019t sound at all the sort of individual who would enjoy keeping high explosive in the house!",
        "So there\u2019s to be no cabling to Lord Nasby?\u2019 I shook my head. \u2018And yet you believe him",
        "to be innocent?\u2019 \u2018I also believe that innocent people can be hanged.\u2019 \u2018H\u2019m! yes.",
        "But, Anne dear, you can face facts, face them now.",
        "In spite of all you say, he may have murdered this woman.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 I said. \u2018He didn\u2019t.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s",
        "sentiment.\u2019 \u2018No, it isn\u2019t.",
        "He might have killed her.",
        "He may even have followed her there with that idea in mind.",
        "But he wouldn\u2019t take a bit of black cord and strangle her with it.",
        "If he\u2019d done it, he would have strangled her with his bare hands.\u2019 Suzanne gave a little shiver.",
        "Her eyes narrowed appreciatively. \u2018H\u2019m!",
        "Anne, I am beginning to see why you find this young man of yours so attractive!\u2019 Chapter 16",
        "I got an opportunity of tackling Colonel Race on the following morning.",
        "The auction of the sweep had just been concluded, and we walked up and down the deck together.",
        "\u2018How\u2019s the gipsy this morning?",
        "Longing for land and her caravan?\u2019 I shook my head. \u2018Now that the sea is behaving so nicely,",
        "I feel I should like to stay on it for ever and ever.\u2019 \u2018What enthusiasm!\u2019 \u2018Well, isn\u2019t it",
        "lovely this morning?\u2019 We leant together over the rail.",
        "It was a glassy calm.",
        "The sea looked as though it had been oiled.",
        "There were great patches of colour on it, blue, pale green, emerald, purple and deep orange, like a",
        "cubist picture.",
        "There was an occasional flash of silver that showed the flying fish.",
        "The air was moist and warm, almost sticky.",
        "Its breath was like a perfumed caress. \u2018That was a very interesting story you told us last night,\u2019",
        "I said, breaking the silence. \u2018Which one?\u2019 \u2018The one about the diamonds.\u2019 \u2018I believe women are always interested",
        "in diamonds.\u2019 \u2018Of course we are.",
        "By the way, what became of the other young man?",
        "You said there were two of them.\u2019 \u2018Young Lucas?",
        "Well, of course, they couldn\u2019t prosecute one without the other, so he went scot-free too.\u2019 \u2018And what happened",
        "to him?\u2013eventually, I mean.",
        "Does anyone know?\u2019 Colonel Race was looking straight ahead of him out to sea.",
        "His face was as devoid of expression as a mask, but I had an idea that he did",
        "not like my questions.",
        "Nevertheless, he replied readily enough. \u2018He went to the War and acquitted himself bravely.",
        "He was reported missing and wounded\u2013believed killed.\u2019 That told me what I wanted to know.",
        "I asked no more.",
        "But more than ever I wondered how much Colonel Race knew.",
        "The part he was playing in all this puzzled me.",
        "One other thing I did.",
        "That was to interview the night steward.",
        "With a little financial encouragement, I soon got him to talk. \u2018The lady wasn\u2019t frightened, was she miss?",
        "It seemed a harmless sort of joke.",
        "A bet, or so I understood.\u2019 I got it all out of him, little by little.",
        "On the voyage from Cape Town to England one of the passengers had handed him a roll of",
        "film with instructions that they were to be dropped on to the bunk in Cabin 71 at 1",
        "am on January 22nd on the outward journey.",
        "A lady would be occupying the cabin, and the affair was described as a bet.",
        "I gathered the steward had been liberally paid for his part in the transaction.",
        "The lady\u2019s name had not been mentioned.",
        "Of course, as Mrs Blair went straight into Cabin 71, interviewing the purser as soon as she got",
        "on board, it never occurred to the steward that she was not the lady in question.",
        "The name of the passenger who had arranged the transaction was Carton, and his description tallied exactly with",
        "that of the man killed on the Tube.",
        "So one mystery, at all events, was cleared up, and the diamonds were obviously the key to the",
        "whole situation.",
        "Those last days on the Kilmorden seemed to pass very quickly.",
        "As we drew nearer and nearer to Cape Town, I was forced to consider carefully my future plans.",
        "There were so many people I wanted to keep an eye on.",
        "Mr Chichester, Sir Eustace and his secretary, and\u2013yes, Colonel Race!",
        "What was I to do about it?",
        "Naturally it was Chichester who had first claim on my attention.",
        "Indeed, I was on the point of reluctantly dismissing Sir Eustace and Mr Pagett from their position of",
        "suspicious characters when a chance conversation awakened fresh doubts in my mind.",
        "I had forgotten Mr Pagett\u2019s incomprehensible emotion at the mention of Florence.",
        "On the last evening on board we were all sitting on deck and Sir Eustace addressed a perfectly",
        "innocent question to his secretary.",
        "I forget exactly what it was, something to do with railway delays in Italy, but at once I",
        "noticed that Mr Pagett was displaying the same uneasiness which had caught my attention before.",
        "When Sir Eustace claimed Mrs Blair for a dance, I quickly moved into the chair next to the",
        "secretary.",
        "I was determined to get to the bottom of the matter. \u2018I have always longed to go to",
        "Italy,\u2019 I said. \u2018And especially to Florence.",
        "Didn\u2019t you enjoy it very much there?\u2019 \u2018Indeed I did, Miss Beddingfeld.",
        "If you will excuse me, there is some correspondence of Sir Eustace\u2019s that\u2013\u2019 I took hold of him",
        "firmly by his coat sleeve. \u2018Oh, you mustn\u2019t run away!\u2019 I cried with the skittish accent of an",
        "elderly dowager. \u2018I\u2019m sure Sir Eustace wouldn\u2019t like you to leave me alone with no one to talk",
        "to.",
        "You never seem to want to talk about Florence.",
        "Oh, Mr Pagett, I believe you have a guilty secret!\u2019 I still had my hand on his arm,",
        "and I could feel the sudden start he gave. \u2018Not at all, Miss Beddingfeld, not at all,\u2019 he",
        "said earnestly. \u2018I should be only too delighted to tell you all about it, but there really are",
        "some cables\u2013\u2019 \u2018Oh, Mr Pagett, what a thin pretence!",
        "I shall tell Sir Eustace\u2013\u2019 I got no further.",
        "He gave another jump.",
        "The man\u2019s nerves seemed in a shocking state. \u2018What is it you want to know?\u2019 The resigned martyrdom",
        "of his tone made me smile inwardly. \u2018Oh, everything!",
        "The pictures, the olive trees\u2013\u2019 I paused, rather at a loss myself. \u2018I suppose you speak Italian?\u2019 I",
        "resumed. \u2018Not a word, unfortunately.",
        "But of course, with hall porters and\u2013er\u2013guides.\u2019 \u2018Exactly,\u2019 I hastened to reply. \u2018And which was your favourite picture?\u2019",
        "\u2018Oh, er\u2013the Madonna\u2013er, Raphael, you know.\u2019 \u2018Dear old Florence,\u2019 I murmured sentimentally.",
        "So picturesque on the banks of the Arno.",
        "A beautiful river.",
        "And the Duomo, you remember the Duomo?\u2019 \u2018Of course, of course.\u2019 \u2018Another beautiful river, is it not?\u2019 I",
        "hazarded. \u2018Almost more beautiful than the Arno?\u2019 \u2018Decidedly so, I should say.\u2019 Emboldened by the success of my",
        "little trap, I proceeded further.",
        "But there was little room for doubt.",
        "Mr Pagett delivered himself into my hands with every word he uttered.",
        "The man had never been in Florence in his life.",
        "But if not in Florence, where had he been?",
        "In England?",
        "Actually in England at the time of the Mill House Mystery?",
        "I decided on a bold step. \u2018The curious thing is,\u2019 I said, \u2018that I fancied I had seen",
        "you before somewhere.",
        "But I must be mistaken\u2013since you were in Florence at the time.",
        "And yet\u2013\u2019 I studied him frankly.",
        "There was a hunted look in his eyes.",
        "He passed his tongue over dry lips. \u2018Where\u2013er\u2013where\u2013\u2019 \u2018Did I think I had seen you?\u2019 I finished for",
        "him. \u2018At Marlow.",
        "You know Marlow?",
        "Why, of course, how stupid of me, Sir Eustace has a house there!\u2019 But with an incoherent muttered",
        "excuse, my victim rose and fled.",
        "That night I invaded Suzanne\u2019s cabin, alight with excitement. \u2018You see, Suzanne,\u2019 I urged, as I finished my",
        "tale, \u2018he was in England, in Marlow, at the time of the murder.",
        "Are you so sure now that \u201cThe Man in the Brown Suit\u201d is guilty?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m sure of one",
        "thing,\u2019 Suzanne said, twinkling, unexpectedly. \u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 \u2018That \u201cThe Man in the Brown Suit\u201d is better looking than",
        "poor Mr Pagett.",
        "No, Anne, don\u2019t get cross.",
        "I was only teasing.",
        "Sit down here.",
        "Joking apart, I think you\u2019ve made a very important discovery.",
        "Up till now, we\u2019ve considered Pagett as having an alibi.",
        "Now we know he hasn\u2019t.\u2019 \u2018Exactly,\u2019 I said. \u2018We must keep an eye on him.\u2019 \u2018As well as",
        "everybody else,\u2019 she said ruefully. \u2018Well, that\u2019s one of the things I wanted to talk to you about.",
        "That\u2013and finance.",
        "No, don\u2019t stick your nose in the air.",
        "I know you are absurdly proud and independent, but you\u2019ve got to listen to horse sense over this.",
        "We\u2019re partners\u2013I wouldn\u2019t offer you a penny because I liked you, or because you\u2019re a friendless girl\u2013what I",
        "want is a thrill, and I\u2019m prepared to pay for it.",
        "We\u2019re going into this together regardless of expense.",
        "To begin with you\u2019ll come with me to the Mount Nelson Hotel at my expense, and we\u2019ll plan",
        "out our campaign.\u2019 We argued the point.",
        "In the end I gave in.",
        "But I didn\u2019t like it.",
        "I wanted to do the thing on my own. \u2018That\u2019s settled,\u2019 said Suzanne at last, getting up and",
        "stretching herself with a big yawn. \u2018I\u2019m exhausted with my own eloquence.",
        "Now then, let us discuss our victims.",
        "Mr Chichester is going on to Durban.",
        "Sir Eustace is going to the Mount Nelson Hotel in Cape Town and then up to Rhodesia.",
        "He\u2019s going to have a private car on the railway, and in a moment of expansion, after his",
        "fourth glass of champagne the other night, he offered me a place in it.",
        "I dare say he didn\u2019t really mean it, but, all the same, he can\u2019t very well back out",
        "if I hold him to it.\u2019 \u2018Good,\u2019 I approved. \u2018You keep an eye on Sir Eustace and Mr",
        "Pagett, and I take on Chichester.",
        "But what about Colonel Race?\u2019 Suzanne looked at me queerly. \u2018Anne, you can\u2019t possibly suspect\u2013\u2019 \u2018I do.",
        "I suspect everybody.",
        "I\u2019m in the mood when one looks round for the most unlikely person.\u2019 \u2018Colonel Race is going to",
        "Rhodesia too,\u2019 said Suzanne thoughtfully. \u2018If we could arrange for Sir Eustace to invite him also\u2013\u2019 \u2018You can",
        "manage it.",
        "You can manage anything.\u2019 \u2018I love butter,\u2019 purred Suzanne.",
        "We parted on the understanding that Suzanne should employ her talents to her best advantage.",
        "I felt too excited to go to bed immediately.",
        "It was my last night on board.",
        "Early tomorrow morning we should be in Table Bay.",
        "I slipped up on deck.",
        "The breeze was fresh and cool.",
        "The boat was rolling a little in the choppy sea.",
        "The decks were dark and deserted.",
        "It was after midnight.",
        "I leaned over the rail, watching the phosphorescent trail of foam.",
        "Ahead of us lay Africa, we were rushing towards it through the dark water.",
        "I felt alone in a wonderful world.",
        "Wrapped in a strange peace, I stood there, taking no heed of time, lost in a dream.",
        "And suddenly I had a curious intimate premonition of danger.",
        "I had heard nothing, but I swung round instinctively.",
        "A shadowy form had crept up behind me.",
        "As I turned, it sprang.",
        "One hand gripped my throat, stifling any cry I might have uttered.",
        "I fought desperately, but I had no chance.",
        "I was half choking from the grip on my throat, but I bit and clung and scratched in",
        "the most approved feminine fashion.",
        "The man was handicapped by having to keep me from crying out.",
        "If he had succeeded in reaching me unawares it would have been easy enough for him to sling",
        "me overboard with a sudden heave.",
        "The sharks would have taken care of the rest.",
        "Struggle as I would, I felt myself weakening.",
        "My assailant felt it too.",
        "He put out all his strength.",
        "And then, running on swift noiseless feet, another shadow joined in.",
        "With one blow of his fist, he sent my opponent crashing headlong to the deck.",
        "Released, I fell back against the rail, sick and trembling.",
        "My rescuer turned to me with a quick movement. \u2018You\u2019re hurt!\u2019 There was something savage in his tone\u2013a",
        "menace against the person who had dared to hurt me.",
        "Even before he spoke I had recognized him.",
        "It was my man\u2013the man with the scar.",
        "But that one moment in which his attention had been diverted to me had been enough for the",
        "fallen enemy.",
        "Quick as a flash he had risen to his feet and taken to his heels down the deck.",
        "With an oath Rayburn sprang after him.",
        "I always hate being out of things.",
        "I joined the chase\u2013a bad third.",
        "Round the deck we went to the starboard side of the ship.",
        "There by the saloon door lay the man in a crumpled heap.",
        "Rayburn was bending over him. \u2018Did you hit him again?\u2019 I called breathlessly. \u2018There was no need,\u2019 he",
        "replied grimly. \u2018I found him collapsed by the door.",
        "Or else he couldn\u2019t get it open and is shamming.",
        "We\u2019ll soon see about that.",
        "And we\u2019ll see who he is too.\u2019 With a beating heart I drew nearer.",
        "I had realized at once that my assailant was a bigger man than Chichester.",
        "Anyway, Chichester was a flabby creature who might use a knife at a pinch, but who would have",
        "little strength in his bare hands.",
        "Rayburn struck a match.",
        "We both uttered an ejaculation.",
        "The man was Guy Pagett.",
        "Rayburn appeared absolutely stupefied by the discovery. \u2018Pagett,\u2019 he muttered. \u2018My God, Pagett.\u2019 I felt a slight sense",
        "of superiority. \u2018You seem surprised.\u2019 \u2018I am,\u2019 he said heavily. \u2018I never suspected\u2013\u2019 He wheeled suddenly round on",
        "me. \u2018And you?",
        "You\u2019re not?",
        "You recognized him, I suppose, when he attacked you?\u2019 \u2018No, I didn\u2019t.",
        "All the same, I\u2019m not so very surprised.\u2019 He stared at me suspiciously. \u2018Where do you come in,",
        "I wonder?",
        "And how much do you know?\u2019 I smiled. \u2018A good deal, Mr\u2013er\u2013Lucas!\u2019 He caught my arm, the unconscious",
        "strength of his grip made me wince. \u2018Where did you get that name?\u2019 he asked hoarsely. \u2018Isn\u2019t it",
        "yours?\u2019 I demanded sweetly. \u2018Or do you prefer to be called \u201cThe Man in the Brown Suit\u201d?\u2019 That",
        "did stagger him.",
        "He released my arm and fell back a pace or two. \u2018Are you a girl, or a witch?\u2019",
        "he breathed. \u2018I\u2019m a friend,\u2019 I advanced a step towards him. \u2018I offered you my help once\u2013I offer",
        "it again.",
        "Will you have it?\u2019 The fierceness of his answer took me aback. \u2018No.",
        "I\u2019ll have no truck with you or with any woman.",
        "Do your damnedest.\u2019 As before, my own temper began to rise. \u2018Perhaps,\u2019 I said, \u2018you don\u2019t realize how",
        "much in my power you are?",
        "A word from me to the Captain\u2013\u2019 \u2018Say it,\u2019 he sneered.",
        "Then advancing with a quick step: \u2018And whilst we\u2019re realizing things, my dear girl, do you realize you\u2019re",
        "in my power this minute?",
        "I could take you by the throat like this.\u2019 With a swift gesture he suited the action to",
        "the word.",
        "I felt his two hands clasp my throat and press\u2013ever so little. \u2018Like this\u2013and squeeze the life out",
        "of you!",
        "And then\u2013like our unconscious friend here, but with more success\u2013fling your dead body to the sharks.",
        "What do you say to that?\u2019 I said nothing.",
        "I laughed.",
        "And yet I knew that the danger was real.",
        "Just at that moment he hated me.",
        "But I knew that I loved the danger, loved the feeling of his hands on my throat.",
        "That I would not have exchanged that moment for any moment in my life.",
        "With a short laugh he released me. \u2018What\u2019s your name?\u2019 he asked abruptly. \u2018Anne Beddingfeld.\u2019 \u2018Does nothing frighten",
        "you, Anne Beddingfeld?\u2019 \u2018Oh, yes,\u2019 I said, with an assumption of coolness I was far from feeling. \u2018Wasps,",
        "sarcastic women, very young men, cockroaches, and superior shop assistants.\u2019 He gave the same short laugh as before.",
        "Then he stirred the unconscious form of Pagett with his feet. \u2018What shall we do with this junk?",
        "Throw it overboard?\u2019 he asked carelessly. \u2018If you like,\u2019 I answered with equal calm. \u2018I admire your whole-hearted,",
        "bloodthirsty instincts, Miss Beddingfeld.",
        "But we will leave him to recover at his leisure.",
        "He is not seriously hurt.\u2019 \u2018You shrink from a second murder, I see,\u2019 I said sweetly. \u2018A second",
        "murder?\u2019 He looked genuinely puzzled. \u2018The woman at Marlow,\u2019 I reminded him, watching the effect of my words",
        "closely.",
        "An ugly brooding expression settled down on his face.",
        "He seemed to have forgotten my presence. \u2018I might have killed her,\u2019 he said. \u2018Sometimes I believe that",
        "I meant to kill her\u2026\u2019 A wild rush of feeling, hatred of the dead woman, surged through me.",
        "I could have killed her that moment, had she stood before me\u2026For he must have loved her once\u2013he",
        "must\u2013he must\u2013to have felt like that!",
        "I regained control of myself and spoke in my normal voice: \u2018We seem to have said all there",
        "is to be said\u2013except good night.\u2019 \u2018Good night and goodbye, Miss Beddingfeld.\u2019 \u2018Au revoir, Mr Lucas.\u2019 Again he",
        "flinched at the name.",
        "He came nearer. \u2018Why do you say that\u2013au revoir, I mean?\u2019 \u2018Because I have a fancy that we",
        "shall meet again.\u2019 \u2018Not if I can help it!\u2019 Emphatic as his tone was, it did not offend",
        "me.",
        "On the contrary, I hugged myself with secret satisfaction.",
        "I am not quite a fool. \u2018All the same,\u2019 I said gravely, \u2018I think we shall.\u2019 \u2018Why?\u2019 I",
        "shook my head, unable to explain the feeling that had actuated my words. \u2018I never wish to see",
        "you again,\u2019 he said suddenly, and violently.",
        "It was really a very rude thing to say, but I only laughed softly and slipped away into",
        "the darkness.",
        "I heard him start after me, and then pause, and a word floated down the deck.",
        "I think it was \u2018witch\u2019!",

        "Extract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler",
        "Mount Nelson Hotel, Cape Town.",
        "It is really the greatest relief to get off the Kilmorden.",
        "The whole time that I was on board I was conscious of being surrounded by a network of",
        "intrigue.",
        "To put the lid on everything, Guy Pagett must needs engage in a drunken brawl the last night.",
        "It is all very well to explain it away, but that is what it actually amounts to.",
        "What else would you think if a man comes to you with a lump the size of an",
        "egg on the side of his head and an eye coloured all the tints of the rainbow?",
        "Of course Pagett would insist on trying to be mysterious about the whole thing.",
        "According to him, you would think his black eye was the direct result of his devotion to my",
        "interests.",
        "His story was extraordinarily vague and rambling and it was a long time before I could make head",
        "or tail of it.",
        "To begin with, it appears he caught sight of a man behaving suspiciously.",
        "Those are Pagett\u2019s words.",
        "He has taken them straight from the pages of a German spy story.",
        "What he means by a man behaving suspiciously he doesn\u2019t know himself.",
        "I said so to him. \u2018He was slinking along in a very furtive manner, and it was the",
        "middle of the night, Sir Eustace.\u2019 \u2018Well, what were you doing yourself?",
        "Why weren\u2019t you in bed and asleep like a good Christian?\u2019 I demanded irritably. \u2018I had been coding",
        "those cables of yours, Sir Eustace, and typing the diary up to date.\u2019 Trust Pagett to be always",
        "in the right and a martyr over it! \u2018Well?\u2019 \u2018I just thought I would have a look round",
        "before turning in, Sir Eustace.",
        "The man was coming down the passage from your cabin.",
        "I thought at once there was something wrong by the way he looked about him.",
        "He slunk up the stairs by the saloon.",
        "I followed him. \u2018My dear Pagett,\u2019 I said, \u2018why shouldn\u2019t the poor chap go on deck without having",
        "his footsteps dogged?",
        "Lots of people even sleep on deck\u2013very uncomfortable, I\u2019ve always thought.",
        "The sailors wash you down with the rest of the deck at five in the morning.\u2019 I shuddered",
        "at the idea. \u2018Anyway,\u2019 I continued, \u2018if you went worrying some poor devil who was suffering from insomnia,",
        "I don\u2019t wonder he landed you one.\u2019 Pagett looked patient. \u2018If you would hear me out, Sir Eustace.",
        "I was convinced the man had been prowling about near your cabin where he had no business to",
        "be.",
        "The only two cabins down that passage are yours and Colonel Race\u2019s.\u2019 \u2018Race,\u2019 I said, lighting a cigar",
        "carefully, \u2018can look after himself without your assistance, Pagett.\u2019 I added as an afterthought: \u2018So can I.\u2019 Pagett",
        "came nearer and breathed heavily as he always does before imparting a secret. \u2018You see, Sir Eustace, I",
        "fancied\u2013and now indeed I am sure\u2013it was Rayburn.\u2019 \u2018Rayburn?\u2019 \u2018Yes, Sir Eustace.\u2019 I shook my head. \u2018Rayburn has",
        "far too much sense to attempt to wake me up in the middle of the night.\u2019 \u2018Quite so,",
        "Sir Eustace.",
        "I think it was Colonel Race he went to see.",
        "A secret meeting\u2013for orders!\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t hiss at me, Pagett,\u2019 I said, drawing back a little, \u2018and do control",
        "your breathing.",
        "Your idea is absurd.",
        "Why should they want to have a secret meeting in the middle of the night?",
        "If they\u2019d anything to say to each other, they could hobnob over beef-tea in a perfectly casual and",
        "natural manner.\u2019 I could see that Pagett was not in the least convinced. \u2018Something was going on last",
        "night, Sir Eustace,\u2019 he urged, \u2018or why should Rayburn assault me so brutally?\u2019 \u2018You\u2019re quite sure it was",
        "Rayburn?\u2019 Pagett appeared to be perfectly convinced of that.",
        "It was the only part of the story that he wasn\u2019t vague about. \u2018There\u2019s something very queer about",
        "all this,\u2019 he said. \u2018To begin with, where is Rayburn?\u2019 It\u2019s perfectly true that we haven\u2019t seen the",
        "fellow since we came on shore.",
        "He did not come up to the hotel with us.",
        "I decline to believe that he is afraid of Pagett, however.",
        "Altogether the whole thing is very annoying.",
        "One of my secretaries has vanished into the blue, and the other looks like a disreputable prize-fighter.",
        "I can\u2019t take him about with me in his present condition.",
        "I shall be the laughing-stock of Cape Town.",
        "I have an appointment later in the day to deliver old Milray\u2019s billet-doux, but I shall not take",
        "Pagett with me.",
        "Confound the fellow and his prowling ways.",
        "Although I am decidedly out of temper.",
        "I had a poisonous breakfast with poisonous people.",
        "Dutch waitresses with thick ankles who took half an hour to bring me a bad bit of fish.",
        "And this farce of getting up at 5 am on arrival at the port to see a blinking",
        "doctor and hold your hands above your head simply makes me tired.",
        "Later.",
        "A very serious thing has occurred.",
        "I went to my appointment with the Prime Minister, taking Milray\u2019s sealed letter.",
        "It didn\u2019t look as though it had been tampered with, but inside was a blank sheet of paper!",
        "Now, I suppose, I\u2019m in the devil of a mess.",
        "Why I ever let that bleating old fool Milray embroil me in the matter I can\u2019t think.",
        "Pagett is a famous Job\u2019s comforter.",
        "He displays a certain gloomy satisfaction that maddens me.",
        "Also, he had taken advantage of my perturbation to saddle me with the stationery trunk.",
        "Unless he is careful, the next funeral he attends will be his own.",
        "However in the end I had to listen to him. \u2018Supposing, Sir Eustace, that Rayburn had overheard a",
        "word or two of your conversation with Mr Milray in the street?",
        "Remember, you had no written authority from Mr Milray.",
        "You accepted Rayburn on his own valuation.\u2019 \u2018You think Rayburn is a crook, then?\u2019 I said slowly.",
        "Pagett did.",
        "How far his views were influenced by resentment over his black eye I don\u2019t know.",
        "He made out a pretty fair case against Rayburn.",
        "And the appearance of the latter told against him.",
        "My idea was to do nothing in the matter.",
        "A man who has permitted himself to be made a thorough fool of is not anxious to broadcast",
        "the fact.",
        "But Pagett, his energy unimpaired by his recent misfortunes, was all for vigorous measures.",
        "He had his way, of course.",
        "He bustled out to the police station, sent innumerable cables, and brought a herd of English and Dutch",
        "officials to drink whiskies and sodas at my expense.",
        "We got Milray\u2019s answer that evening.",
        "He knew nothing of my late secretary!",
        "There was only one spot of comfort to be extracted from the situation. \u2018At any rate,\u2019 I said",
        "to Pagett, \u2018you weren\u2019t poisoned.",
        "You had one of your ordinary bilious attacks.\u2019 I saw him wince.",
        "It was my only score.",
        "Later.",
        "Pagett is in his element.",
        "His brain positively scintillates with bright ideas.",
        "He will have it now that Rayburn is none other than the famous \u2018Man in the Brown Suit\u2019.",
        "I dare say he is right.",
        "He usually is.",
        "But all this is getting unpleasant.",
        "The sooner I get off to Rhodesia the better.",
        "I have explained to Pagett that he is not to accompany me. \u2018You see, my dear fellow,\u2019 I",
        "said, \u2018you must remain here on the spot.",
        "You might be required to identify Rayburn any minute.",
        "And, besides, I have my dignity as an English Member of Parliament to think of.",
        "I can\u2019t go about with a secretary who has apparently recently been indulging in a vulgar street-brawl.\u2019 Pagett",
        "winced.",
        "He is such a respectable fellow that his appearance is pain and tribulation to him. \u2018But what will",
        "you do about your correspondence, and the notes for your speeches, Sir Eustace?\u2019 \u2018I shall manage,\u2019 I said",
        "airily. \u2018Your private car is to be attached to the eleven-o\u2019clock train tomorrow, Wednesday, morning,\u2019 Pagett continued. \u2018I",
        "have made all arrangements.",
        "Is Mrs Blair taking a maid with her?\u2019 \u2018Mrs Blair?\u2019 I gasped. \u2018She tells me you offered her",
        "a place.\u2019 So I did, now I come to think of it.",
        "On the night of the Fancy Dress ball.",
        "I even urged her to come.",
        "But I never thought she would.",

        "I caught a fast train to Muizenberg and got there in about half an hour.",
        "It was a nice trip.",
        "We wound slowly round the base of Table Mountain, and some of the flowers were lovely.",
        "My geography being weak, I had never fully realized that Cape Town is on a peninsula, consequently I",
        "was rather surprised on getting out of the train to find myself facing the sea once more.",
        "There was some perfectly entrancing bathing going on.",
        "The people had short curved boards and came floating in on the waves.",
        "It was far too early to go to tea.",
        "I made for the bathing pavilion, and when they said would I have a surf board, I said",
        "\u2018Yes, please.\u2019 Surfing looks perfectly easy.",
        "It isn\u2019t .",

        "Surfing is like that.",
        "You are either vigorously cursing or else you are idiotically pleased with yourself.",
        "I found the Villa Medgee after some difficulty.",

        "I rang the bell, and a smiling Kafir boy answered it. \u2018Mrs Raffini?\u2019 I inquired.",
        "He ushered me in, preceded me down the passage and flung open a door.",
        "Just as I was about to pass in, I hesitated.",
        "I felt a sudden misgiving.",
        "I stepped over the threshold and the door swung sharply behind me.",
        "A man rose from his seat behind a table and came forward with outstretched hand. \u2018So glad we",
        "have persuaded you to visit us, Miss Beddingfeld,\u2019 he said.",
        "He was a tall man, obviously a Dutchman, with a flaming orange beard.",
        "He did not look in the least like the curator of a museum.",
        "In fact, I realized in a flash that I had made a fool of myself.",
        "I was in the hands of the enemy.",
        "Chapter 19 It reminded me forcibly of Episode III in \u2018The Perils of Pamela\u2019.",

        "yearning for similar things to happen to me!",
        "Well, they had happened with a vengeance.",
        "And somehow it was not nearly so amusing as I had imagined.",

        "Tell the truth, he had said.",
        "Well, I could always do that, but was it going to help me?",
        "To begin with, would my story be believed?",
        "Would they consider it likely or possible that I had started off on this mad escapade simply on",
        "the strength of a scrap of paper smelling of mothballs?",
        "It sounded to me a wildly incredible tale.",
        "In that moment of cold sanity I cursed myself for a melodramatic idiot, and yearned for the peaceful",
        "boredom of Little Hampsley.",
        "All this passed through my mind in less time than it takes to tell.",
        "My first instinctive movement was to step backwards and feel for the handle of the door.",
        "My captor merely grinned. \u2018Here you are and here you stay,\u2019 he remarked facetiously.",
        "I did my best to put a bold face upon the matter. \u2018I was invited to come here",
        "by the curator of the Cape Town Museum.",
        "If I have made a mistake\u2013\u2019 \u2018A mistake?",
        "Oh, yes, a big mistake!\u2019 He laughed coarsely. \u2018What right have you to detain me?",
        "I shall inform the police\u2013\u2019 \u2018Yap, yap, yap\u2013like a little toy dog.\u2019 He laughed.",
        "I sat down on a chair. \u2018I can only conclude that you are a dangerous lunatic,\u2019 I said",
        "coldly. \u2018Indeed?\u2019 \u2018I should like to point out to you that my friends are perfectly well aware where",
        "I have gone, and that if I have not returned by this evening, they will come in search",
        "of me.",
        "You understand?\u2019 \u2018So your friends know where you are, do they?",
        "Which of them?\u2019 Thus challenged, I did a lightning calculation of chances.",
        "Should I mention Sir Eustace?",
        "He was a well-known man, and his name might carry weight.",
        "But if they were in touch with Pagett, they might know I was lying.",
        "Better not risk Sir Eustace. \u2018Mrs Blair, for one,\u2019 I said lightly. \u2018A friend of mine with whom",
        "I am staying.\u2019 \u2018I think not,\u2019 said my captor, slyly shaking his orange head. \u2018You have not seen",
        "her since eleven this morning.",
        "And you received our note, bidding you to come here, at lunchtime.\u2019 His words showed me how closely",
        "my movements had been followed, but I was not going to give in without a fight. \u2018You are",
        "very clever,\u2019 I said. \u2018Perhaps you have heard of that useful invention, the telephone?",
        "Mrs Blair called me up on it when I was resting in my room after lunch.",
        "I told her then where I was going this afternoon.\u2019 To my great satisfaction, I saw a shade",
        "of uneasiness pass over his face.",
        "Clearly he had overlooked the possibility that Suzanne might have telephoned me.",
        "I wished she really had done so! \u2018Enough of this,\u2019 he said harshly, rising. \u2018What are you going",
        "to do with me?\u2019 I asked, still endeavouring to appear composed. \u2018Put you where you can do no",
        "harm in case your friends come after you.\u2019 For a moment my blood ran cold, but his next",
        "words reassured me. \u2018Tomorrow you\u2019ll have some questions to answer, and after you\u2019ve answered them we shall know",
        "what to do with you.",
        "And I can tell you, young lady, we\u2019ve more ways than one of making obstinate little fools talk.\u2019",
        "It was not cheering, but it was at least a respite.",
        "I had until tomorrow.",
        "This man was clearly an underling obeying the orders of a superior.",
        "Could that superior by any chance be Pagett?",
        "He called and two Kafirs appeared.",
        "I was taken upstairs.",
        "Despite my struggles, I was gagged and then bound hand and foot.",
        "The room into which they had taken me was a kind of attic right under the roof.",
        "It was dusty and showed little signs of having been occupied.",
        "The Dutchman made a mock bow and withdrew, closing the door behind him.",
        "I was quite helpless.",
        "Turn and twist as I would, I could not loosen my bonds in the slightest degree, and the",
        "gag prevented me from crying out.",
        "If, by any possible chance, anyone did come to the house, I could do nothing to attract their",
        "attention.",
        "Down below I heard the sound of a door shutting.",
        "Evidently the Dutchman was going out.",
        "It was maddening not to be able to do anything.",
        "I strained again at my bonds, but the knots held.",
        "I desisted at last, and either fainted or fell asleep.",
        "When I awoke I was in pain all over.",
        "It was quite dark now, and I judged that the night must be well advanced, for the moon",
        "was high in the heavens and shining down through the dusty skylight.",
        "The gag was half choking me and the stiffness and pain were unendurable.",
        "It was then that my eyes fell on a bit of broken glass lying in the corner.",
        "A moonbeam slanted right down on it, and its glistening had caught my attention.",
        "As I looked at it, an idea came into my head.",
        "My arms and legs were helpless, but surely I could still roll .",
        "Slowly and awkwardly, I set myself in motion.",
        "It was not easy.",
        "Besides being extremely painful, since I could not guard my face with my arms, it was also exceedingly",
        "difficult to keep any particular direction.",
        "I tended to roll in every direction except the one I wanted to go.",
        "In the end, however, I came right up against my objective.",
        "It almost touched my bound hands.",
        "Even then it was not easy.",
        "It took an infinity of time before I could wriggle the glass into such a position, wedged against",
        "the wall, that it would rub up and down on my bonds.",
        "It was a long heart-rending process, and I almost despaired, but in the end I succeeded in sawing",
        "through the cords that bound my wrists.",
        "The rest was a matter of time.",
        "Once I had restored the circulation to my hands by rubbing the wrists vigorously, I was able to",
        "undo the gag.",
        "One or two full breaths did a lot for me.",
        "Very soon I had undone the last knot, though even then it was some time before I could",
        "stand on my feet, but at last I stood erect, swinging my arms to and fro to restore",
        "the circulation, and wishing above all things that I could get hold of something to eat.",
        "I waited about a quarter of an hour, to be quite sure of my recovered strength.",
        "Then I tiptoed noiselessly to the door.",
        "As I had hoped, it was not locked, only latched.",
        "I unlatched it and peeped cautiously out.",
        "Everything was still.",
        "The moonlight came in through a window and showed me the dusty uncarpeted staircase.",
        "Cautiously I crept down it.",
        "Still no sound\u2013but as I stood on the landing below, a faint murmur of voices reached me.",
        "I stopped dead, and stood there for some time.",
        "A clock on the wall registered the fact that it was after midnight.",
        "I was fully aware of the risks I might run if I descended lower, but my curiosity was",
        "too much for me.",
        "With infinite precautions I prepared to explore.",
        "I crept softly down the last flight of stairs and stood in the square hall.",
        "I looked round me\u2013and then caught my breath with a gasp.",
        "A Kafir boy was sitting by the hall door.",
        "He had not seen me, indeed I soon realized by his breathing that he was fast asleep.",
        "Should I retreat, or should I go on?",
        "The voices came from the room I had been shown into on arrival.",
        "One of them was that of my Dutch friend, the other I could not for the moment recognize,",
        "though it seemed vaguely familiar.",
        "In the end I decided that it was clearly my duty to hear all I could.",
        "I must risk the Kafir boy waking up.",
        "I crossed the hall noiselessly and knelt by the study door.",
        "For a moment or two I could hear no better.",
        "The voices were louder, but I could not distinguish what they said.",
        "I applied my eye to the keyhole instead of my ear.",
        "As I had guessed, one of the speakers was the big Dutchman.",
        "The other man was sitting outside my circumscribed range of vision.",
        "Suddenly he rose to get himself a drink.",
        "His back, blackclad and decorous, came into view.",
        "Even before he turned round I knew who he was.",
        "Mr Chichester!",
        "Now I began to make out the words. \u2018All the same, it is dangerous.",
        "Suppose her friends come after her?\u2019 It was the big man speaking.",
        "Chichester answered him.",
        "He had dropped his clerical voice entirely.",
        "No wonder I had not recognized it. \u2018All bluff.",
        "They haven\u2019t an idea where she is.\u2019 \u2018She spoke very positively.\u2019 \u2018I dare say.",
        "I\u2019ve looked into the matter, and we\u2019ve nothing to fear.",
        "Anyway, it\u2019s the \u201cColonel\u2019s\u201d orders.",
        "You don\u2019t want to go against them, I suppose?\u2019 The Dutchman ejaculated something in his own language.",
        "I judged it to be a hasty disclaimer. \u2018But why not knock her on the head?\u2019 he growled.",
        "\u2018It would be simple.",
        "The boat is all ready.",
        "She could be taken out to sea.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Chichester meditatively. \u2018That is what I should do.",
        "She knows too much, that is certain.",
        "But the \u201cColonel\u201d is a man who likes to play a lone hand\u2013though no one else must do",
        "so.\u2019 Something in his own words seemed to awaken a memory that annoyed him. \u2018He wants information of",
        "some kind from this girl.\u2019 He had paused before the \u2018information\u2019, and the Dutchman was quick to catch",
        "him up. \u2018Information?\u2019 \u2018Something of the kind.\u2019 \u2018Diamonds,\u2019 I said to myself. \u2018And now,\u2019 continued Chichester, \u2018give me",
        "the lists.\u2019 For a long time their conversation was quite incomprehensible to me.",
        "It seemed to deal with large quantities of vegetables.",
        "Dates were mentioned, prices, and various names of places which I did not know.",
        "It was quite half an hour before they had finished their checking and counting. \u2018Good,\u2019 said Chichester, and",
        "there was a sound as though he pushed back his chair. \u2018I will take these with me for",
        "the \u201cColonel\u201d to see.\u2019 \u2018When do you leave?\u2019 \u2018Ten o\u2019clock tomorrow morning will do.\u2019 \u2018Do you want to",
        "see the girl before you go?\u2019 \u2018No.",
        "There are strict orders that no one is to see her until the \u201cColonel\u201d comes.",
        "Is she all right?\u2019 \u2018I looked in on her when I came in for dinner.",
        "She was asleep, I think.",
        "What about food?\u2019 \u2018A little starvation will do no harm.",
        "The \u201cColonel\u201d will be here some time tomorrow.",
        "She will answer questions better if she is hungry.",
        "No one had better go near her till then.",
        "Is she securely tied up?\u2019 The Dutchman laughed. \u2018What do you think?\u2019 They both laughed.",
        "So did I, under my breath.",
        "Then, as the sounds seemed to betoken that they were about to come out of the room, I",
        "beat a hasty retreat.",
        "I was just in time.",
        "As I reached the head of the stairs, I heard the door of the room open, and at",
        "the same time the Kafir stirred and moved.",
        "My retreat by the way of the hall door was not to be thought of.",
        "I retired prudently to the attic, gathered my bonds round me and lay down again on the floor,",
        "in case they should take it into their heads to come and look at me.",
        "They did not do so, however.",
        "After about an hour, I crept down the stairs, but the Kafir by the door was awake and",
        "humming softly to himself.",
        "I was anxious to get out of the house, but I did not quite see how to manage",
        "it.",
        "In the end, I was forced to retreat to the attic again.",
        "The Kafir was clearly on guard for the night.",
        "I remained there patiently all through the sounds of early morning preparation.",
        "The men breakfasted in the hall, I could hear their voices distinctly floating up the stairs.",
        "I was getting thoroughly unnerved.",
        "How on earth was I to get out of the house?",
        "I counselled myself to be patient.",
        "A rash move might spoil everything.",
        "After breakfast came the sounds of Chichester departing.",
        "To my intense relief, the Dutchman accompanied him.",
        "I waited breathlessly.",
        "Breakfast was being cleared away, the work of the house was being done.",
        "At last, the various activities seemed to die down.",
        "I slipped out from my lair once more.",
        "Very carefully I crept down the stairs.",
        "The hall was empty.",
        "Like a flash I was across it, had unlatched the door, and was outside in the sunshine.",
        "I ran down the drive like one possessed.",
        "Once outside, I resumed a normal walk.",
        "People stared at me curiously, and I do not wonder.",
        "My face and clothes must have been covered in dust from rolling about in the attic.",
        "At last I came to a garage.",
        "I went in. \u2018I have met with an accident,\u2019 I explained. \u2018I want a car to take me",
        "to Cape Town at once.",
        "I must catch the boat to Durban.\u2019 I had not long to wait.",
        "Ten minutes later I was speeding along in the direction of Cape Town.",
        "I must know if Chichester was on the boat.",
        "Whether to sail on her myself or not, I could not determine, but in the end I decided",
        "to do so.",
        "Chichester would not know that I had seen him in the Villa at Muizenberg.",
        "He would doubtless lay further traps for me, but I was forewarned.",
        "And he was the man I was after, the man who was seeking the diamonds on behalf of",
        "the mysterious \u2018Colonel\u2019.",
        "Alas, for my plans!",
        "As I arrived at the docks, the Kilmorden Castle was steaming out to sea.",
        "And I had no means of knowing whether Chichester had sailed on her or not!",
        "Chapter 20 I drove to the hotel.",
        "There was no one in the lounge that I knew.",
        "I ran upstairs and tapped on Suzanne\u2019s door.",
        "Her voice bade me \u2018come in\u2019.",
        "When she saw who it was she literally fell on my neck. \u2018Anne, dear, where have you been?",
        "I\u2019ve been worried to death about you.",
        "What have you been doing?\u2019 \u2018Having adventures,\u2019 I replied. \u2018Episode III of \u201cThe Perils of Pamela\u201d.\u2019 I told",
        "her the whole story.",
        "She gave vent to a deep sigh when I finished. \u2018Why do these things always happen to you?\u2019",
        "she demanded plaintively. \u2018Why does no one gag me and bind me hand and foot?\u2019 \u2018You wouldn\u2019t like",
        "it if they did,\u2019 I assured her. \u2018To tell you the truth, I\u2019m not nearly so keen on",
        "having adventures myself as I was.",
        "A little of that sort of thing goes a long way.\u2019 Suzanne seemed unconvinced.",
        "An hour or two of gagging and binding would have changed her view quickly enough.",
        "Suzanne likes thrills, but she hates being uncomfortable. \u2018And what are we all doing now?\u2019 she asked. \u2018I",
        "don\u2019t quite know,\u2019 I said thoughtfully. \u2018You still go to Rhodesia, of course, to keep an eye on",
        "Pagett\u2013\u2019 \u2018And you?\u2019 That was just my difficulty.",
        "Had Chichester gone on the Kilmorden , or had he not?",
        "Did he mean to carry out his original plan of going to Durban?",
        "The hour of his leaving Muizenberg seemed to point to an affirmative answer to both questions.",
        "In that case, I might go to Durban by train.",
        "I fancied that I should get there before the boat.",
        "On the other hand, if the news of my escape were wired to Chichester, and also the information",
        "that I had left Cape Town for Durban, nothing was simpler for him than to leave the boat",
        "at either Port Elizabeth or East London and so give me the slip completely.",
        "It was rather a knotty problem. \u2018We\u2019ll inquire about trains to Durban anyway,\u2019 I said. \u2018And it\u2019s not",
        "too late for morning tea,\u2019 said Suzanne. \u2018We\u2019ll have it in the lounge.\u2019 The Durban train left at",
        "8.15 that evening, so they told me at the office.",
        "For the moment I postponed decision, and joined Suzanne for somewhat belated \u2018eleven-o\u2019clock tea\u2019. \u2018Do you feel that",
        "you would really recognize Chichester again\u2013in any other disguise, I mean?\u2019 asked Suzanne.",
        "I shook my head ruefully. \u2018I certainly didn\u2019t recognize him as the stewardess, and never should have but",
        "for your drawing.\u2019 \u2018The man\u2019s a professional actor, I\u2019m sure of it,\u2019 said Suzanne thoughtfully. \u2018His make-up is",
        "perfectly marvellous.",
        "He might come off the boat as a navvy or something, and you\u2019d never spot him.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019re very",
        "cheering,\u2019 I said.",
        "At that minute Colonel Race stepped in through the window and came and joined us. \u2018What is Sir",
        "Eustace doing?\u2019 asked Suzanne. \u2018I haven\u2019t seen him about today.\u2019 Rather an odd expression passed over the Colonel\u2019s",
        "face. \u2018He\u2019s got a little trouble of his own to attend to which is keeping him busy.\u2019 \u2018Tell",
        "us about it.\u2019 \u2018I mustn\u2019t tell tales out of school.\u2019 \u2018Tell us something\u2013even if you have to invent",
        "it for our special benefit.\u2019 \u2018Well, what would you say to the famous \u201cMan in the Brown Suit\u201d",
        "having made the voyage with us?\u2019 \u2018 What? \u2019 I felt the colour die out of my face",
        "and then surge back again.",
        "Fortunately Colonel Race was not looking at me. \u2018It\u2019s a fact, I believe.",
        "Every port watched for him and he bamboozled Pedler into bringing him out as his secretary!\u2019 \u2018Not Mr",
        "Pagett?\u2019 \u2018Oh, not Pagett\u2013the other fellow.",
        "Rayburn, he called himself.\u2019 \u2018Have they arrested him?\u2019 asked Suzanne.",
        "Under the table she gave my hand a reassuring squeeze.",
        "I waited breathlessly for an answer. \u2018He seems to have disappeared into thin air.\u2019 \u2018How does Sir Eustace",
        "take it?\u2019 \u2018Regards it as a personal insult offered him by Fate.\u2019 An opportunity of hearing Sir Eustace\u2019s",
        "views on the matter presented itself later in the day.",
        "We were awakened from a refreshing afternoon nap by a pageboy with a note.",
        "In touching terms it requested the pleasure of our company at tea in his sitting-room.",
        "The poor man was indeed in a pitiable state.",
        "He poured out his troubles to us, encouraged by Suzanne\u2019s sympathetic murmurs.",
        "She does that sort of thing very well.",
        "\u2018First a perfectly strange woman has the impertinence to get herself murdered in my house\u2013on purpose to annoy",
        "me, I do believe.",
        "Why my house?",
        "Why, of all the houses in Great Britain, choose the Mill House?",
        "What harm had I ever done the woman that she must needs get herself murdered there?\u2019 Suzanne made",
        "one of her sympathetic noises again and Sir Eustace proceeded, in a still more aggrieved tone: \u2018And, if",
        "that\u2019s not enough, the fellow who murdered her has the impudence, the colossal impudence, to attach himself to",
        "me as my secretary.",
        "My secretary, if you please!",
        "I\u2019m tired of secretaries, I won\u2019t have any more secretaries.",
        "Either they\u2019re concealed murderers or else they\u2019re drunken brawlers.",
        "Have you seen Pagett\u2019s black eye?",
        "But of course you have.",
        "How can I go about with a secretary like that?",
        "And his face is such a nasty shade of yellow too\u2013just the colour that doesn\u2019t go with a",
        "black eye.",
        "I\u2019ve done with secretaries\u2013unless I have a girl.",
        "A nice girl, with liquid eyes, who\u2019ll hold my hand when I\u2019m feeling cross.",
        "What about you, Miss Anne?",
        "Will you take on the job?\u2019 \u2018How often shall I have to hold your hand?\u2019 I asked, laughing.",
        "\u2018All day long,\u2019 replied Sir Eustace gallantly. \u2018I shan\u2019t get much typing done at that rate,\u2019 I reminded",
        "him. \u2018That doesn\u2019t matter.",
        "All this work is Pagett\u2019s idea.",
        "He works me to death.",
        "I\u2019m looking forward to leaving him behind in Cape Town.\u2019 \u2018He is staying behind?\u2019 \u2018Yes, he\u2019ll enjoy himself",
        "thoroughly sleuthing about after Rayburn.",
        "That\u2019s the sort of thing that suits Pagett down to the ground.",
        "He adores intrigue.",
        "But I\u2019m quite serious in my offer.",
        "Will you come?",
        "Mrs Blair here is a competent chaperone, and you can have a half-holiday every now and again to",
        "dig for bones.\u2019 \u2018Thank you very much, Sir Eustace,\u2019 I said cautiously, \u2018but I think I\u2019m leaving for",
        "Durban tonight.\u2019 \u2018Now don\u2019t be an obstinate girl.",
        "Remember, there are lots of lions in Rhodesia.",
        "You\u2019ll like lions.",
        "All girls do.\u2019 \u2018Will they be practising low jumps?\u2019 I asked, laughing. \u2018No, thank you very much, but",
        "I must go to Durban.\u2019 Sir Eustace looked at me, sighed deeply, then opened the door of the",
        "adjoining room, and called to Pagett. \u2018If you\u2019ve quite finished your afternoon sleep, my dear fellow, perhaps you\u2019d",
        "do a little work for a change.\u2019 Guy Pagett appeared in the doorway.",
        "He bowed to us both, starting slightly at the sight of me, and replied in a melancholy voice:",
        "\u2018I have been typing that memorandum all this afternoon, Sir Eustace.\u2019 \u2018Well, stop typing it then.",
        "Go down to the Trade Commissioner\u2019s Office, or the Board of Agriculture, or the Chamber of Mines, or",
        "one of those places, and ask them to lend me some kind of a woman to take to",
        "Rhodesia.",
        "She must have liquid eyes and not object to my holding her hand.\u2019 \u2018Yes, Sir Eustace.",
        "I will ask for a competent shorthand-typist.\u2019 \u2018Pagett\u2019s a malicious fellow,\u2019 said Sir Eustace, after the secretary had",
        "departed. \u2018I\u2019d be prepared to bet that he\u2019ll pick out some slab-faced creature on purpose to annoy me.",
        "She must have nice feet too\u2013I forgot to mention that.\u2019 I clutched Suzanne excitedly by the hand and",
        "almost dragged her along to her room. \u2018Now, Suzanne,\u2019 I said, \u2018we\u2019ve got to make plans\u2013and make them",
        "quickly.",
        "Pagett is staying behind here\u2013you heard that?\u2019 \u2018Yes.",
        "I suppose that means that I shan\u2019t be allowed to go to Rhodesia\u2013which is very annoying, because I",
        "want to go to Rhodesia.",
        "How tiresome.\u2019 \u2018Cheer up,\u2019 I said. \u2018You\u2019re going all right.",
        "I don\u2019t see how you could back out at the last moment without its appearing frightfully suspicious.",
        "And, besides, Pagett might suddenly be summoned by Sir Eustace, and it would be far harder for you",
        "to attach yourself to him for the journey up.\u2019 \u2018It would hardly be respectable,\u2019 said Suzanne, dimpling. \u2018I",
        "should have to pretend a fatal passion for him as an excuse.\u2019 \u2018On the other hand, if you",
        "were there when he arrived, it would all be perfectly simple and natural.",
        "Besides, I don\u2019t think we ought to lose sight of the other two entirely.\u2019 \u2018Oh, Anne, you surely",
        "can\u2019t suspect Colonel Race or Sir Eustace?\u2019 \u2018I suspect everybody,\u2019 I said darkly, \u2018and if you\u2019ve read any",
        "detective stories, Suzanne, you must know that it\u2019s always the most unlikely person who\u2019s the villain.",
        "Lots of criminals have been cheerful fat men like Sir Eustace.\u2019 \u2018Colonel Race isn\u2019t particularly fat\u2013or particularly cheerful",
        "either.\u2019 \u2018Sometimes they\u2019re lean and saturnine,\u2019 I retorted. \u2018I don\u2019t say I seriously suspect either of them, but,",
        "after all, the woman was murdered in Sir Eustace\u2019s house\u2013\u2019 \u2018Yes, yes, we needn\u2019t go over all that",
        "again.",
        "I\u2019ll watch him for you, Anne, and if he gets any fatter and any more cheerful, I\u2019ll send",
        "you a telegram at once.",
        "\u201cSir E. swelling highly suspicious.",
        "Come at once.\u201d\u2019 \u2018Really, Suzanne,\u2019 I cried, \u2018you seem to think all this is a game!\u2019 \u2018I know",
        "I do,\u2019 said Suzanne, unabashed. \u2018It seems like that.",
        "It\u2019s your fault, Anne.",
        "I\u2019ve got imbued with your \u201cLet\u2019s have an adventure\u201d spirit.",
        "It doesn\u2019t seem a bit real.",
        "Dear me, if Clarence knew that I was running about Africa tracking dangerous criminals, he\u2019d have a fit.\u2019",
        "\u2018Why don\u2019t you cable him about it?\u2019 I asked sarcastically.",
        "Suzanne\u2019s sense of humour always fails her when it comes to sending cables.",
        "She considered my suggestion in perfectly good faith. \u2018I might.",
        "It would have to be a very long one.\u2019 Her eyes brightened at the thought. \u2018But I think",
        "it\u2019s better not.",
        "Husbands always want to interfere with perfectly harmless amusements.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 I said, summing up the situation, \u2018you will",
        "keep an eye on Sir Eustace and Colonel Race\u2013\u2019 \u2018I know why I\u2019ve got to watch Sir Eustace,\u2019",
        "interrupted Suzanne, \u2018because of his figure and his humorous conversation.",
        "But I think it\u2019s carrying it rather far to suspect Colonel Race; I do indeed.",
        "Why, he\u2019s something to do with the Secret Service.",
        "Do you know, Anne, I believe the best thing we could do would be to confide in him",
        "and tell him the whole story.\u2019 I objected vigorously to this unsporting proposal.",
        "I recognized in it the disastrous effects of matrimony.",
        "How often have I not heard a perfectly intelligent female say, in the tone of one clinching an",
        "argument, \u2018 Edgar says\u2013\u2019 And all the time you are perfectly aware that Edgar is a perfect fool.",
        "Suzanne, by reason of her married state, was yearning to lean upon some man or other.",
        "However, she promised faithfully that she would not breathe a word to Colonel Race, and we went on",
        "with our plan-making. \u2018It\u2019s quite clear that I must stay here and watch Pagett, and this is the",
        "best way to do it.",
        "I must pretend to leave for Durban this evening, take my luggage down and so on, but really",
        "I shall go to some small hotel in the town.",
        "I can alter my appearance a little\u2013wear a fair toupee and one of those thick white lace veils,",
        "and I shall have a much better chance of seeing what he\u2019s really at if he thinks I\u2019m",
        "safely out of the way.\u2019 Suzanne approved this plan heartily.",
        "We made due and ostentatious preparations, inquiring once more about the departure of the train at the office",
        "and packing my luggage.",
        "We dined together in the restaurant.",
        "Colonel Race did not appear, but Sir Eustace and Pagett were at their table in the window.",
        "Pagett left the table half-way through the meal, which annoyed me, as I had planned to say goodbye",
        "to him.",
        "However, doubtless Sir Eustace would do as well.",
        "I went over to him when I had finished. \u2018Goodbye, Sir Eustace,\u2019 I said. \u2018I\u2019m off tonight to",
        "Durban.\u2019 Sir Eustace sighed heavily. \u2018So I heard.",
        "You wouldn\u2019t like me to come with you, would you?\u2019 \u2018I should love it.\u2019 \u2018Nice girl.",
        "Sure you won\u2019t change your mind and come and look for lions in Rhodesia?\u2019 \u2018Quite sure.\u2019 \u2018He must",
        "be a very handsome fellow,\u2019 said Sir Eustace plaintively. \u2018Some young whipper-snapper in Durban, I suppose, who puts",
        "my mature charms completely in the shade.",
        "By the way, Pagett\u2019s going down in the car in a minute or two.",
        "He could take you to the station.\u2019 \u2018Oh, no, thank you,\u2019 I said hastily. \u2018Mrs Blair and I",
        "have got our own taxi ordered.\u2019 To go down with Guy Pagett was the last thing I wanted!",
        "Sir Eustace looked at me attentively. \u2018I don\u2019t believe you like Pagett.",
        "I don\u2019t blame you.",
        "Of all the officious, interfering asses\u2013going about with the air of a martyr, and doing everything he can",
        "to annoy and upset me!\u2019 \u2018What has he done now?\u2019 I inquired with some curiosity. \u2018He\u2019s got hold",
        "of a secretary for me.",
        "You never saw such a woman!",
        "Forty, if she\u2019s a day, wears pince-nez and sensible boots and an air of brisk efficiency that will",
        "be the death of me.",
        "A regular slab-faced woman.\u2019 \u2018Won\u2019t she hold your hand?\u2019 \u2018I devoutly hope not!\u2019 exclaimed Sir Eustace. \u2018That would",
        "be the last straw.",
        "Well, goodbye, liquid eyes.",
        "If I shoot a lion I shan\u2019t give you the skin\u2013after the base way you\u2019ve deserted me.\u2019 He",
        "squeezed my hand warmly and we parted.",
        "Suzanne was waiting for me in the hall.",
        "She was to come down to see me off. \u2018Let\u2019s start at once,\u2019 I said hastily, and motioned",
        "to the man to get a taxi.",
        "Then a voice behind me made me start: \u2018Excuse me, Miss Beddingfeld, but I\u2019m just going down in",
        "a car.",
        "I can drop you and Mrs Blair at the station.\u2019 \u2018Oh, thank you,\u2019 I said hastily. \u2018But there\u2019s",
        "no need to trouble you.",
        "I\u2013\u2019 \u2018No trouble at all, I assure you.",
        "Put the luggage in, porter.\u2019 I was helpless.",
        "I might have protested further, but a slight warning nudge from Suzanne urged me to be on my",
        "guard. \u2018Thank you, Mr Pagett,\u2019 I said coldly.",
        "We all got into the car.",
        "As we raced down the road into the town, I racked my brains for something to say.",
        "In the end Pagett himself broke the silence. \u2018I have secured a very capable secretary for Sir Eustace,\u2019",
        "he observed. \u2018Miss Pettigrew.\u2019 \u2018He wasn\u2019t exactly raving about her just now,\u2019 I remarked.",
        "Pagett looked at me coldly. \u2018She is a proficient shorthand-typist,\u2019 he said repressively.",
        "We pulled up in front of the station.",
        "Here surely he would leave us.",
        "I turned with outstretched hand\u2013but no. \u2018I\u2019ll come and see you off.",
        "It\u2019s just eight o\u2019clock, your train goes in a quarter of an hour.\u2019 He gave efficient directions to",
        "porters.",
        "I stood helpless, not daring to look at Suzanne.",
        "The man suspected.",
        "He was determined to make sure that I did go by the train.",
        "And what could I do?",
        "Nothing.",
        "I saw myself, in a quarter of an hour\u2019s time, steaming out of the station with Pagett planted",
        "on the platform waving me adieu.",
        "He had turned the tables on me adroitly.",
        "His manner towards me had changed, moreover.",
        "It was full of an uneasy geniality which sat ill upon him, and which nauseated me.",
        "The man was an oily hypocrite.",
        "First he tried to murder me, and now he paid me compliments!",
        "Did he imagine for one minute that I hadn\u2019t recognized him that night on the boat?",
        "No, it was a pose, a pose which he forced me to acquiesce in, his tongue in his",
        "cheek all the while.",
        "Helpless as a sheep, I moved along under his expert directions.",
        "My luggage was piled in my sleeping compartment\u2013I had a two-berth one to myself.",
        "It was twelve minutes past eight.",
        "In three minutes the train would start.",
        "But Pagett had reckoned without Suzanne. \u2018It will be a terribly hot journey, Anne,\u2019 she said suddenly. \u2018Especially",
        "going through the Karoo tomorrow.",
        "You\u2019ve got some eau-de-Cologne or lavender water with you, haven\u2019t you?\u2019 My cue was plain. \u2018Oh, dear,\u2019 I",
        "cried. \u2018I left my eau-de-Cologne on the dressing-table at the hotel.\u2019 Suzanne\u2019s habit of command served her well.",
        "She turned imperiously to Pagett. \u2018Mr Pagett.",
        "Quick.",
        "You\u2019ve just time.",
        "There\u2019s a chemist almost opposite the station.",
        "Anne must have some eau-de-Cologne.\u2019 He hesitated, but Suzanne\u2019s imperative manner was too much for him.",
        "She is a born autocrat.",
        "He went.",
        "Suzanne followed him with her eyes till he disappeared. \u2018Quick, Anne, get out the other side\u2013in case he",
        "hasn\u2019t really gone but is watching us from the end of the platform.",
        "Never mind your luggage.",
        "You can telegraph about that tomorrow.",
        "Oh, if only the train starts on time!\u2019 I opened the gate on the opposite side to the",
        "platform and climbed down.",
        "Nobody was observing me.",
        "I could just see Suzanne standing where I had left her, looking up at the train and apparently",
        "chatting to me at the window.",
        "A whistle blew, the train began to draw out.",
        "Then I heard feet racing furiously up the platform.",
        "I withdrew to the shadow of a friendly bookstall and watched.",
        "Suzanne turned from waving her handkerchief to the retreating train. \u2018Too late, Mr Pagett,\u2019 she said cheerfully. \u2018She\u2019s",
        "gone.",
        "Is that the eau-de-Cologne?",
        "What a pity we didn\u2019t think of it sooner!\u2019 They passed not far from me on their way",
        "out of the station.",
        "Guy Pagett was extremely hot.",
        "He had evidently run all the way to the chemist and back. \u2018Shall I get you a taxi,",
        "Mrs Blair?\u2019 Suzanne did not fail in her role. \u2018Yes, please.",
        "Can\u2019t I give you a lift back?",
        "Have you much to do for Sir Eustace?",
        "Dear me, I wish Anne Beddingfeld was coming with us tomorrow.",
        "I don\u2019t like the idea of a young girl like that travelling off to Durban all by herself.",
        "But she was set upon it.",
        "Some little attraction there, I fancy\u2013\u2019 They passed out of earshot.",
        "Clever Suzanne.",
        "She had saved me.",
        "I allowed a minute or two to elapse and then I too made my way out of the",
        "station, almost colliding as I did so with a man\u2013an unpleasant-looking man with a nose disproportionately big for",
        "his face.",
        "Chapter 21 I had no further difficulty in carrying out my plans.",
        "I found a small hotel in a back street, got a room there, paid a deposit as I",
        "had no luggage with me, and went placidly to bed.",
        "On the following morning I was up early and went out into the town to purchase a modest",
        "wardrobe.",
        "My idea was to do nothing until after the departure of the eleven-o\u2019clock train to Rhodesia with most",
        "of the party on board.",
        "Pagett was not likely to indulge in any nefarious activities until he had got rid of them.",
        "Accordingly I took a train out of the town and proceeded to enjoy a country walk.",
        "It was comparatively cool, and I was glad to stretch my legs after the long voyage and my",
        "close confinement at Muizenberg.",
        "A lot hinges on small things.",
        "My shoe-lace came untied, and I stopped to do it up.",
        "The road had just turned a corner, and as I was bending over the offending shoe a man",
        "came right round and almost walked into me.",
        "He lifted his hat, murmuring an apology, and went on.",
        "It struck me at the time that his face was vaguely familiar, but at the moment I thought",
        "no more of it.",
        "I looked at my wrist-watch.",
        "The time was getting on.",
        "I turned my feet in the direction of Cape Town.",
        "There was a tram on the point of going and I had to run for it.",
        "I heard other footsteps running behind me.",
        "I swung myself on and so did the other runner.",
        "I recognized him at once.",
        "It was the man who had passed me on the road when my shoe came untied, and in",
        "a flash I knew why his face was familiar.",
        "It was the small man with the big nose whom I had run into on leaving the station",
        "the night before.",
        "The coincidence was rather startling.",
        "Could it be possible that the man was deliberately following me?",
        "I resolved to test that as promptly as possible.",
        "I rang the bell and got off at the next stop.",
        "The man did not get off.",
        "I withdrew into the shadow of a shop doorway and watched.",
        "He alighted at the next stop and walked back in my direction.",
        "The case was clear enough.",
        "I was being followed.",
        "I had crowed too soon.",
        "My victory over Guy Pagett took on another aspect.",
        "I hailed the next tram and, as I expected, my shadower also got on.",
        "I gave myself up to some very serious thinking.",
        "It was perfectly apparent that I had stumbled on a bigger thing than I knew.",
        "The murder in the house at Marlow was not an isolated incident committed by a solitary individual.",
        "I was up against a gang, and, thanks to Colonel Race\u2019s revelations to Suzanne, and what I had",
        "overheard at the house at Muizenberg, I was beginning to understand some of its manifold activities.",
        "Systematized crime, organized by the man known to his followers as the \u2018Colonel\u2019!",
        "I remembered some of the talk I had heard on board ship, of the strike on the Rand",
        "and the causes underlying it\u2013and the belief that some secret organization was at work fomenting the agitation.",
        "That was the \u2018Colonel\u2019s\u2019 work, his emissaries were acting according to plan.",
        "He took no part in these things himself, I had always heard, as he limited himself to directing",
        "and organizing.",
        "The brain-work\u2013not the dangerous labour\u2013for him.",
        "But still it well might be that he himself was on the spot, directing affairs from an apparently",
        "impeccable position.",
        "That, then, was the meaning of Colonel Race\u2019s presence on the Kilmorden Castle .",
        "He was out after the arch-criminal.",
        "Everything fitted in with that assumption.",
        "He was someone high up in the Secret Service whose business it was to lay the \u2018Colonel\u2019 by",
        "the heels.",
        "I nodded to myself\u2013things were becoming very clear to me.",
        "What of my part in the affair?",
        "Where did I come in?",
        "Was it only diamonds they were after?",
        "I shook my head.",
        "Great as the value of the diamonds might be, they hardly accounted for the desperate attempts which had",
        "been made to get me out of the way.",
        "No, I stood for more than that.",
        "In some way, unknown to myself, I was a menace, a danger!",
        "Some knowledge that I had, or that they thought I had, made them anxious to remove me at",
        "all costs\u2013and that knowledge was bound up somehow with the diamonds.",
        "There was one person, I felt sure, who could enlighten me\u2013if he would! \u2018The Man in the Brown",
        "Suit\u2019\u2013Harry Rayburn.",
        "He knew the other half of the story.",
        "But he had vanished into the darkness, he was a hunted creature flying from pursuit.",
        "In all probability he and I would never meet again\u2026 I brought myself back with a jerk to",
        "the actualities of the moment.",
        "It was no good thinking sentimentally of Harry Rayburn.",
        "He had displayed the greatest antipathy to me from the first.",
        "Or, at least\u2013There I was again\u2013dreaming!",
        "The real problem was what to do\u2013 now!",
        "I, priding myself upon my role of watcher, had become the watched.",
        "And I was afraid!",
        "For the first time, I began to lose my nerve.",
        "I was the little bit of grit that was impeding the smooth working of the great machine\u2013and I",
        "fancied that the machine would have a short way with little bits of grit.",
        "Once Harry Rayburn had saved me, once I had saved myself\u2013but I felt suddenly that the odds were",
        "heavily against me.",
        "My enemies were all around me in every direction, and they were closing in.",
        "If I continued to play a lone hand I was doomed.",
        "I rallied myself with an effort.",
        "After all, what could they do?",
        "I was in a civilized city\u2013with policemen every few yards.",
        "I would be wary in future.",
        "They should not trap me again as they had done in Muizenberg.",
        "As I reached this point in my meditations, the tram arrived at Adderley Street.",
        "I got out.",
        "Undecided what to do, I walked slowly up the left-hand side of the street.",
        "I did not trouble to look if my watcher was behind me.",
        "I knew he was.",
        "I walked into Cartwright\u2019s and ordered two coffee ice-cream sodas\u2013to steady my nerves.",
        "A man, I suppose, would have had a stiff peg; but girls derive a lot of comfort from",
        "ice-cream sodas.",
        "I applied myself to the end of the straw with gusto.",
        "The cool liquid went trickling down my throat in the most agreeable manner.",
        "I pushed the first glass aside empty.",
        "I was sitting on one of the little high stools in front of the counter.",
        "Out of the tail of my eye, I saw my tracker come in and sit down unostentatiously at",
        "a little table near the door.",
        "I finished the second coffee soda and demanded a maple one.",
        "I can drink practically an unlimited amount of ice-cream sodas.",
        "Suddenly the man by the door got up and went out.",
        "That surprised me.",
        "If he was going to wait ouside, why not wait outside from the beginning?",
        "I slipped down from my stool and went cautiously to the door.",
        "I drew back quickly into the shadow.",
        "The man was talking to Guy Pagett.",
        "If I had ever had any doubts, that would have settled it.",
        "Pagett had his watch out and was looking at it.",
        "They exchanged a few brief words, and then the secretary swung on down the street towards the station.",
        "Evidently he had given his orders.",
        "But what were they?",
        "Suddenly my heart leapt into my mouth.",
        "The man who had followed me crossed to the middle of the road and spoke to a policeman.",
        "He spoke at some length, gesticulating towards Cartwright\u2019s and evidently explaining something.",
        "I saw the plan at once.",
        "I was to be arrested on some charge or other\u2013pocket-picking, perhaps.",
        "It would be easy enough for the gang to put through a simple little matter like that.",
        "Of what good to protest my innocence?",
        "They would have seen to every detail.",
        "Long ago they had brought a charge of robbing De Beers against Harry Rayburn, and he had not",
        "been able to disprove it, though I had little doubt but that he had been absolutely blameless.",
        "What chance had I against such a \u2018frame up\u2019 as the \u2018Colonel\u2019 could devise?",
        "I glanced up at the clock almost mechanically, and immediately another aspect of the case struck me.",
        "I saw the point of Guy Pagett\u2019s looking at his watch.",
        "It was just on eleven, and at eleven the mail train left for Rhodesia bearing with it the",

        "That was the reason of my immunity up to now.",
        "From last night till eleven this morning I had been safe, but now the net was closing in",
        "upon me.",
        "I hurriedly opened my bag and paid for my drinks, and as I did so, my heart seemed",
        "to stand still, for inside it was a man\u2019s wallet stuffed with notes!",
        "It must have been deftly introduced into my handbag as I left the tram.",
        "Promptly I lost my head.",
        "I hurried out of Cartwright\u2019s.",
        "The little man with the big nose and the policeman were just crossing the road.",
        "They saw me, and the little man designated me excitedly to the policeman.",
        "I took to my heels and ran.",
        "I judged him to be a slow policeman.",
        "I should get a start.",
        "But I had no plan, even then.",
        "I just ran for my life down Adderley Street.",
        "People began to stare.",
        "I felt that in another minute someone would stop me.",
        "An idea flashed into my head. \u2018The station?\u2019 I asked, in a breathless gasp. \u2018Just down on the",
        "right.\u2019 I sped on.",
        "It is permissible to run for a train.",
        "I turned into the station, but as I did so I heard footsteps close behind me.",
        "The little man with the big nose was a champion sprinter.",
        "I foresaw that I should be stopped before I got to the platform I was in search of.",
        "I looked up to the clock\u2013one minute to eleven.",
        "I might just do it if my plan succeeded.",
        "I had entered the station by the main entrance in Adderley Street.",
        "I now darted out again through the side exit.",
        "Directly opposite me was the side entrance to the post office, the main entrance to which is in",
        "Adderley Street.",
        "As I expected, my pursuer, instead of following me in, ran down the street to cut me off",
        "when I emerged by the main entrance, or to warn the policeman to do so.",
        "In an instant I slipped across the street again and back into the station.",
        "I ran like a lunatic.",
        "It was just eleven.",
        "The long train was moving as I appeared on the platform.",
        "A porter tried to stop me, but I wriggled myself out of his grasp and sprang upon the",
        "foot-board.",
        "I mounted the two steps and opened the gate.",
        "I was safe!",
        "The train was gathering way.",
        "We passed a man standing by himself at the end of the platform.",
        "I waved to him. \u2018Goodbye Mr Pagett,\u2019 I shouted.",
        "Never have I seen a man more taken aback.",
        "He looked as though he had seen a ghost.",
        "In a minute or two I was having trouble with the conductor.",
        "But I took a lofty tone. \u2018I am Sir Eustace Pedler\u2019s secretary,\u2019 I said haughtily. \u2018Please take me",
        "to his private car.\u2019 Suzanne and Colonel Race were standing on the rear observation platform.",
        "They both uttered an exclamation of utter surprise at seeing me. \u2018Hullo, Miss Anne,\u2019 cried Colonel Race, \u2018where",
        "have you turned up from?",
        "I thought you\u2019d gone to Durban.",
        "What an unexpected person you are!\u2019 Suzanne said nothing, but her eyes asked a hundred questions. \u2018I must",
        "report myself to my chief,\u2019 I said demurely. \u2018Where is he?\u2019 \u2018He\u2019s in the office\u2013middle compartment\u2013dictating at an",
        "incredible rate to the unfortunate Miss Pettigrew.\u2019 \u2018This enthusiasm for work is something new,\u2019 I commented. \u2018H\u2019m!\u2019 said",
        "Colonel Race. \u2018His idea is, I think, to give her sufficient work to chain her to her typewriter",
        "in her own compartment for the rest of the day.\u2019 I laughed.",
        "Then, followed by the other two, I sought out Sir Eustace.",
        "He was striding up and down the circumscribed space, hurling a flood of words at the unfortunate secretary",
        "whom I now saw for the first time.",
        "A tall, square woman in drab clothing, with pince-nez and an efficient air.",
        "I judged that she was finding it difficult to keep pace with Sir Eustace, for her pencil was",
        "flying along, and she was frowning horribly.",
        "I stepped into the compartment. \u2018Come aboard, sir,\u2019 I said saucily.",
        "Sir Eustace paused dead in the middle of a complicated sentence on the labour situation, and stared at",
        "me.",
        "Miss Pettigrew must be a nervous creature, in spite of her efficient air, for she jumped as though",
        "she had been shot. \u2018God bless my soul!\u2019 ejaculated Sir Eustace. \u2018What about the young man in Durban?\u2019",
        "\u2018I prefer you,\u2019 I said softly. \u2018Darling,\u2019 said Sir Eustace. \u2018You can start holding my hand at once.\u2019",
        "Miss Pettigrew coughed, and Sir Eustace hastily withdrew his hand. \u2018Ah, yes,\u2019 he said. \u2018Let me see, where",
        "were we?",
        "Yes.",
        "Tylman Roos, in his speech at\u2013What\u2019s the matter?",
        "Why aren\u2019t you taking it down?\u2019 \u2018I think,\u2019 said Colonel Race gently, \u2018that Miss Pettigrew has broken her",
        "pencil.\u2019 He took it from her and sharpened it.",
        "Sir Eustace stared, and so did I.",
        "There was something in Colonel Race\u2019s tone that I did not quite understand.",
        "Chapter 22",
        "Extract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler",
        "I am inclined to abandon my Reminiscences.",
        "Instead, I shall write a short article entitled \u2018Secretaries I have had\u2019.",
        "As regards secretaries, I seem to have fallen under a blight.",
        "At one minute I have no secretaries, at another I have too many.",
        "At the present minute I am journeying to Rhodesia with a pack of women.",
        "Race goes off with the two best-looking, of course, and leaves me with the dud.",
        "That is what always happens to me\u2013and, after all, this is my private car, not Race\u2019s.",
        "Also Anne Beddingfeld is accompanying me to Rhodesia on the pretext of being my temporary secretary.",
        "But all this afternoon she has been out on the observation platform with Race exclaiming at the beauty",
        "of the Hex River Pass.",
        "It is true that I told her her principal duty would be to hold my hand.",
        "But she isn\u2019t even doing that.",
        "Perhaps she is afraid of Miss Pettigrew.",
        "I don\u2019t blame her if so.",
        "There is nothing attractive about Miss Pettigrew\u2013she is a repellent female with large feet, more like a man",
        "than a woman.",
        "There is something very mysterious about Anne Beddingfeld.",
        "She jumped on board the train at the last minute, puffing like a steam-engine, for all the world",
        "as though she\u2019s been running a race\u2013and yet Pagett told me that he\u2019d seen her off to Durban",
        "last night!",
        "Either Pagett has been drinking again, or else the girl must have an astral body.",
        "And she never explains.",
        "Nobody ever explains.",
        "Yes, \u2018Secretaries I have had\u2019.",
        "No. 1, a murderer fleeing from justice.",
        "No. 2, a secret drinker who carries on disreputable intrigues in Italy.",
        "No. 3, a beautiful girl who possesses the useful faculty of being in two places at once.",
        "No. 4, Miss Pettigrew, who, I have no doubt, is really a particularly dangerous crook in disguise!",
        "Probably one of Pagett\u2019s Italian friends that he has palmed off on me.",
        "I shouldn\u2019t wonder if the world found some day that it had been grossly deceived by Pagett.",
        "On the whole, I think Rayburn was the best of the bunch.",
        "He never worried me or got in my way.",
        "Guy Pagett has had the impertinence to have the stationery trunk put in here.",
        "None of us can move without falling over it.",
        "I went out on the observation platform just now, expecting my appearance to be greeted with hails of",
        "delight.",

        "I shall label this car\u2013not \u2018Sir Eustace Pedler and Party\u2019, but \u2018Colonel Race and Harem.\u2019 Then Mrs Blair",
        "must needs begin taking silly photographs.",
        "Every time we went round a particularly appalling curve, as we climbed higher and higher, she snapped at",
        "the engine. \u2018You see the point,\u2019 she cried delightedly. \u2018It must be some curve if you can photograph",
        "the front part of the train from the back, and with the mountain background it will look awfully",
        "dangerous.\u2019 I pointed out to her that no one could possibly tell it had been taken from the",
        "back of the train.",
        "She looked at me pityingly. \u2018I shall write underneath it.",
        "\u201cTaken from the train.",
        "Engine going round a curve.\u201d\u2019 \u2018You could write that under any snapshot of a train,\u2019 I said.",
        "Women never think of these simple things. \u2018I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve come up here in daylight,\u2019 cried Anne Beddingfeld.",
        "\u2018I shouldn\u2019t have seen this if I\u2019d gone last night to Durban, should I?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Colonel Race,",
        "smiling. \u2018You\u2019d have woken up tomorrow morning to find yourself in the Karoo, a hot, dusty desert of",
        "stones and rocks.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m glad I changed my mind,\u2019 said Anne, sighing contentedly, and looking round.",
        "It was rather a wonderful sight.",
        "The great mountains all around, through which we turned and twisted and laboured ever steadily upwards. \u2018Is this",
        "the best train in the day to Rhodesia?\u2019 asked Anne Beddingfeld. \u2018In the day?\u2019 laughed Race. \u2018Why, my",
        "dear Miss Anne, there are only three trains a week.",
        "Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays.",
        "Do you realize that you don\u2019t arrive at the Falls until Saturday next?\u2019 \u2018How well we shall know",
        "each other by that time!\u2019 said Mrs Blair maliciously. \u2018How long are you going to stay at the",
        "Falls, Sir Eustace?\u2019 \u2018That depends,\u2019 I said cautiously. \u2018On what?\u2019 \u2018On how things go at Johannesburg.",
        "My original idea was to stay a couple of days at the Falls\u2013which I\u2019ve never seen, though this",
        "is my third visit to Africa\u2013and then go on to Jo\u2019burg and study the conditions of things on",
        "the Rand.",
        "At home, you know, I pose as being an authority on South African politics.",
        "But from all I hear, Jo\u2019burg will be a particularly unpleasant place to visit in about a week\u2019s",
        "time.",
        "I don\u2019t want to study conditions in the midst of a raging revolution.\u2019 Race smiled in a rather",
        "superior manner. \u2018I think your fears are exaggerated, Sir Eustace.",
        "There will be no great danger in Jo\u2019burg.\u2019 The women immediately looked at him in the \u2018What a",
        "brave hero you are\u2019 manner.",
        "It annoyed me intensely.",
        "I am every bit as brave as Race\u2013but I lack the figure.",
        "These long, lean, brown men have it all their own way. \u2018I suppose you\u2019ll be there,\u2019 I said",
        "coldly. \u2018Very possibly.",
        "We might travel together.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m not sure that I shan\u2019t stay on at the Falls a bit,\u2019 I",
        "answered non-committally.",
        "Why is Race so anxious that I should go to Jo\u2019burg?",
        "He\u2019s got his eye on Anne, I believe. \u2018What are your plans, Miss Anne?\u2019 \u2018That depends,\u2019 she replied",
        "demurely, copying me. \u2018I thought you were my secretary,\u2019 I objected. \u2018Oh, but I\u2019ve been cut out.",
        "You\u2019ve been holding Miss Pettigrew\u2019s hand all the afternoon.\u2019 \u2018Whatever I\u2019ve been doing, I can swear I\u2019ve not",
        "been doing that,\u2019 I assured her.",
        "Thursday night.",
        "We have just left Kimberley.",
        "Race was made to tell the story of the diamond robbery all over again.",
        "Why are women so excited by anything to do with diamonds?",
        "At last Anne Beddingfeld has shed her veil of mystery.",
        "It seems that she\u2019s a newspaper correspondent.",
        "She sent an immense cable from De Aar this morning.",
        "To judge by the jabbering that went on nearly all night in Mrs Blair\u2019s cabin she must have",
        "been reading aloud all her special articles for years to come.",
        "It seems that all along she\u2019s been on the track of \u2018The Man in the Brown Suit\u2019.",
        "Apparently she didn\u2019t spot him on the Kilmorden \u2013in fact, she hardly had the chance, but she\u2019s now",
        "very busy cabling home: \u2018How I journeyed out with the Murderer\u2019, and inventing highly fictitious stories of \u2018What",
        "he said to me\u2019, etc. I know how these things are done.",
        "I do them myself, in my Reminiscences when Pagett will let me.",
        "And of course one of Nasby\u2019s efficient staff will brighten up the details still more, so that when",
        "it appears in the Daily Budget Rayburn won\u2019t recognize himself.",
        "The girl\u2019s clever, though.",
        "All on her own, apparently, she\u2019s ferreted out the identity of the woman who was killed in my",
        "house.",
        "She was a Russian dancer called Nadina.",
        "I asked Anne Beddingfeld if she was sure of this.",
        "She replied that it was merely a deduction\u2013quite in the Sherlock Holmes manner.",
        "However, I gather that she had cabled it home to Nasby as a proved fact.",
        "Women have these intuitions\u2013I\u2019ve no doubt that Anne Beddingfeld is perfectly right in her guess\u2013but to call it",
        "a deduction is absurd.",
        "How she ever got on the staff of the Daily Budget is more than I can imagine.",
        "But she is the kind of young woman who does these things.",
        "Impossible to withstand her.",
        "She is full of coaxing ways that mask an invincible determination.",
        "Look how she has got into my private car!",
        "I am beginning to have an inkling why.",
        "Race said something about the police suspecting that Rayburn would make for Rhodesia.",
        "He might just have got off by Monday\u2019s train.",
        "They telegraphed all along the line, I presume, and no one of his description was found, but that",
        "says little.",
        "He\u2019s an astute young man and he knows Africa.",
        "He\u2019s probably exquisitely disguised as an old Kafir woman\u2013and the simple police continue to look for a handsome",
        "young man with a scar, dressed in the height of European fashion.",
        "I never did quite swallow that scar.",
        "Anyway, Anne Beddingfeld is on his track.",
        "She wants the glory of discovering him for herself and the Daily Budget.",
        "Young women are very cold-blooded nowadays.",
        "I hinted to her that it was an unwomanly action.",
        "She laughed at me.",
        "She assured me that did she run him to earth her fortune was made.",
        "Race doesn\u2019t like it, either, I can see.",
        "Perhaps Rayburn is on this train.",
        "If so, we may all be murdered in our beds.",
        "I said so to Mrs Blair\u2013but she seemed quite to welcome the idea, and remarked that if I",
        "were murdered it would be really a terrific scoop for Anne!",
        "A scoop for Anne, indeed!",
        "Tomorrow we shall be going through Bechuanaland.",
        "The dust will be atrocious.",
        "Also at every station little Kafir children come and sell you quaint wooden animals that they carve themselves.",
        "Also mealie bowls and baskets.",
        "I am rather afraid that Mrs Blair may run amok.",
        "There is a primitive charm about these toys that I feel will appeal to her.",
        "Friday evening.",
        "As I feared.",
        "Mrs Blair and Anne have bought forty-nine wooden animals!",
        "Chapter 23",
        "Anne\u2019s Narrative Resumed",
        "I thoroughly enjoyed the journey up to Rhodesia.",
        "There was something new and exciting to see every day.",
        "First the wonderful scenery of the Hex River valley, then the desolate grandeur of the Karoo, and finally",
        "that wonderful straight stretch of line in Bechaunaland, and the perfectly adorable toys the natives brought to sell.",
        "Suzanne and I were nearly left behind at each station\u2013if you could call them stations.",
        "It seemed to me that the train just stopped whenever it felt like it, and no sooner had",
        "it done so than a horde of natives materialized out of the empty landscape, holding up mealie bowls",
        "and sugar canes and fur karosses and adorable carved wooden animals.",
        "Suzanne began at once to make a collection of the latter.",
        "I imitated her example\u2013most of them cost a \u2018 tiki \u2019",
        "threepence",
        "and each was different.",
        "There were giraffes and tigers and snakes and a melancholy-looking eland and absurd little black warriors.",
        "We enjoyed ourselves enormously.",
        "Sir Eustace tried to restrain us\u2013but in vain.",
        "I still think it was a miracle we were not left behind at some oasis of the line.",
        "South African trains don\u2019t hoot or get excited when they are going to start off again.",
        "They just glide quietly away, and you look up from your bargaining and run for your life.",
        "Suzanne\u2019s amazement at seeing me climb upon the train at Cape Town can be imagined.",
        "We held an exhaustive survey of the situation on the first evening out.",
        "We talked half the night.",
        "It had become clear to me that defensive tactics must be adopted as well as aggressive ones.",
        "Travelling with Sir Eustace Pedler and his party, I was fairly safe.",
        "Both he and Colonel Race were powerful protectors, and I judged that my enemies would not wish to",
        "stir up a hornet\u2019s nest about my ears.",
        "Also, as long as I was near Sir Eustace, I was more or less in touch with Guy",
        "Pagett\u2013and Guy Pagett was the heart of the mystery.",
        "I asked Suzanne whether in her opinion it was possible that Pagett himself was the mysterious \u2018Colonel\u2019.",
        "His subordinate position was, of course, against the assumption, but it had struck me once or twice that,",
        "for all his autocratic ways, Sir Eustace was really very much influenced by his secretary.",
        "He was an easy-going man, and one whom an adroit secretary might be able to twist round his",
        "little finger.",
        "The comparative obscurity of his position might in reality be useful to him, since he would be anxious",
        "to be well out of the limelight.",
        "Suzanne, however, negatived these ideas very strongly.",
        "She refused to believe that Guy Pagett was the ruling spirit.",
        "The real head\u2013the \u2018Colonel\u2019\u2013was somewhere in the background and had probably been already in Africa at the time",
        "of our arrival.",
        "I agreed that there was much to be said for her view, but I was not entirely satisfied.",
        "For in each suspicious instance Pagett had been shown as the directing genius.",
        "It was true that his personality seemed to lack the assurance and decision that one would expect from",
        "a master criminal\u2013but after all, according to Colonel Race, it was brain-work only that this mysterious leader supplied,",
        "and creative genius is often allied to a weak and timorous physical constitution. \u2018There speaks the Professor\u2019s daughter,\u2019",
        "interrupted Suzanne, when I had got to this point in my argument. \u2018It\u2019s true, all the same.",
        "On the other hand, Pagett may be the Grand Vizier, so to speak, of the All Highest.\u2019 I",
        "was silent for a minute or two, and then went on musingly: \u2018I wish I knew how Sir",
        "Eustace made his money!\u2019 \u2018Suspecting him again?\u2019 \u2018Suzanne, I\u2019ve got into that state that I can\u2019t help suspecting",
        "somebody!",
        "I don\u2019t really suspect him\u2013but, after all, he is Pagett\u2019s employer, and he did own the Mill House.\u2019",
        "\u2018I\u2019ve always heard that he made his money in some way he isn\u2019t anxious to talk about,\u2019 said",
        "Suzanne thoughtfully. \u2018But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean crime\u2013it might be tintacks or hair restorer!\u2019 I agreed ruefully. \u2018I",
        "suppose,\u2019 said Suzanne doubtfully, \u2018that we\u2019re not barking up the wrong tree?",
        "Being led completely astray, I mean, by assuming Pagett\u2019s complicity?",
        "Supposing that, after all, he is a perfectly honest man?\u2019 I considered that for a minute or two,",

        "but they\u2019re not very convincing.",
        "For instance, the night he tried to throw me overboard on the Kilmorden , he says he followed",
        "Rayburn up on deck and Rayburn turned and knocked him down.",
        "Now we know that\u2019s not true.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Suzanne unwillingly. \u2018But we only heard the story at second-hand",
        "from Sir Eustace.",
        "If we\u2019d heard it direct from Pagett himself, it might have been different.",
        "You know how people always get a story a little wrong when they repeat it.\u2019 I turned the",
        "thing over in my mind. \u2018No,\u2019 I said at last, \u2018I don\u2019t see any way out.",

        "You can\u2019t get away from the fact that he tried to throw me overboard, and everything else fits",
        "in.",
        "Why are you so persistent in this new idea of yours?\u2019 \u2018Because of his face.\u2019 \u2018His face?",
        "But\u2013\u2019 \u2018Yes, I know what you\u2019re going to say.",
        "It\u2019s a sinister face.",
        "That\u2019s just it.",
        "No man with a face like that could be really sinister.",
        "It must be a colossal joke on the part of Nature.\u2019 I did not believe much in Suzanne\u2019s",
        "argument.",
        "I know a lot about Nature in past ages.",
        "If she\u2019s got a sense of humour, she doesn\u2019t show it much.",

        "We passed on to discuss our immediate plans.",
        "It was clear to me that I must have some kind of standing.",
        "I couldn\u2019t go on avoiding explanations for ever.",

        "My silence or my speech could no longer affect Harry Rayburn.",

        "I could help him best by seeming to be against him.",
        "The \u2018Colonel\u2019 and his gang must have no suspicion that there existed any friendly feeling between me and",
        "the man they had elected to be the scapegoat of the murder at Marlow.",
        "As far as I knew, the woman killed was still unidentified.",
        "I would cable to Lord Nasby, suggesting that she was no other than the famous Russian dancer \u2018Nadina\u2019",
        "who had been delighting Paris for so long.",
        "It seemed incredible to me that she had not been identified already\u2013but when I learnt more of the",
        "case long afterwards I saw how natural it really was.",
        "Nadina had never been to England, during her successful career in Paris.",
        "She was unknown to London audiences.",
        "The pictures in the papers of the Marlow victim were so blurred and unrecognizable that it is small",
        "wonder no one identified them.",
        "And, on the other hand, Nadina had kept her intention of visiting England a profound secret from everyone.",
        "The day after the murder, a letter had been received by her manager purporting to be from the",
        "dancer, in which she said that she was returning to Russia on urgent private affairs and that he",
        "must deal with her broken contract as best he could.",
        "All this, of course, I only learned afterwards.",
        "With Suzanne\u2019s full approval, I sent a long cable from De Aar.",
        "It arrived at a psychological moment",
        "this again, of course, I learnt afterwards .",
        "The Daily Budget was hard up for a sensation.",
        "My guess was verified and proved to be correct and the Daily Budget had the scoop of its",

        "And so on. \u2018Our reporter makes voyage with the murderer.",
        "The Man in the Brown Suit.",
        "What he is really like.\u2019 The main facts were, of course, cabled to the South African papers, but",
        "I only read my own lengthy articles at a much later date!",
        "I received approval and full instructions by cable at Bulawayo.",
        "I was on the staff of the Daily Budget , and I had a private word of congratulation",
        "from Lord Nasby himself.",
        "I was definitely accredited to hunt down the murderer, and I, and only I, knew that the murderer",
        "was not Harry Rayburn!",

        "Chapter 24 We arrived at Bulawayo early on Saturday morning.",
        "I was disappointed in the place.",
        "It was very hot, and I hated the hotel.",
        "Also Sir Eustace was what I can only describe as thoroughly sulky.",
        "I think it was all our wooden animals that annoyed him\u2013especially the big giraffe.",
        "It was a colossal giraffe with an impossible neck, a mild eye and a dejected tail.",
        "It had character.",
        "It had charm.",
        "A controversy was already arising as to whom it belonged to\u2013me or Suzanne.",
        "We had each contributed a tiki to its purchase.",
        "Suzanne advanced the claims of seniority and the married state, I stuck to the position that I had",
        "been the first to behold its beauty.",
        "In the meantime, I must admit, it occupied a good deal of this three-dimensional space of ours.",
        "To carry forty-nine wooden animals, all of awkward shape, and all of extremely brittle wood, is somewhat of",
        "a problem.",
        "Two porters were laden with a bunch of animals each\u2013and one promptly dropped a ravishing group of ostriches",
        "and broke their heads off.",
        "Warned by this, Suzanne and I carried all we could, Colonel Race helped, and I pressed the big",
        "giraffe into Sir Eustace\u2019s arms.",
        "Even the correct Miss Pettigrew did not escape, a large hippopotamus and two black warriors fell to her",
        "share.",
        "I had a feeling Miss Pettigrew didn\u2019t like me.",
        "Perhaps she fancied I was a bold hussy.",
        "Anyway, she avoided me as much as she could.",
        "And the funny thing was, her face seemed vaguely familiar to me, though I couldn\u2019t quite place it.",
        "We reposed ourselves most of the morning, and in the afternoon we drove out to the Matopos to",
        "see Rhodes\u2019s grave.",
        "That is to say, we were to have done so, but at the last moment Sir Eustace backed",
        "out.",
        "He was very nearly in as bad a temper as the morning we arrived at Cape Town\u2013when he",
        "bounced the peaches on the floor and they squashed!",
        "Evidently arriving early in the morning at places is bad for his temperament.",
        "He cursed the porters, he cursed the waiter at breakfast, he cursed the whole hotel management, he would",
        "doubtless have liked to curse Miss Pettigrew, who hovered around with her pencil and pad, but I don\u2019t",
        "think even Sir Eustace would have dared to curse Miss Pettigrew.",
        "She\u2019s just like the efficient secretary in a book.",
        "I only rescued our dear giraffe just in time.",
        "I feel Sir Eustace would have liked to dash him to the ground.",
        "To return to our expedition, after Sir Eustace had backed out, Miss Pettigrew said she would remain at",
        "home in case he might want her.",
        "And at the very last minute Suzanne sent down a message to say she had a headache.",
        "So Colonel Race and I drove off alone.",
        "He is a strange man.",
        "One doesn\u2019t notice it so much in a crowd.",
        "But when one is alone with him the sense of his personality seems really almost overpowering.",
        "He becomes more taciturn, and yet his silence seems to say more than speech might do.",
        "It was so that day that we drove to the Matopos through the soft yellow-brown scrub.",
        "Everything seemed strangely silent\u2013except our car, which I should think was the first Ford ever made by man!",
        "The upholstery of it was torn to ribbons and, though I know nothing about engines, even I could",
        "guess that all was not as it should be in its interior.",
        "By and by the character of the country changed.",
        "Great boulders appeared, piled up into fantastic shapes.",
        "I felt suddenly that I had got into a primitive era.",
        "Just for a moment Neanderthal men seemed quite as real to me as they had to Papa.",
        "I turned to Colonel Race. \u2018There must have been giants once,\u2019 I said dreamily. \u2018And their children were",
        "just like children are today\u2013they played with handfuls of pebbles, piling them up and knocking them down, and",
        "the more cleverly they balanced them, the better pleased they were.",
        "If I were to give a name to this place I should call it The Country of Giant",
        "Children.\u2019 \u2018Perhaps you\u2019re nearer the mark than you know,\u2019 said Colonel Race gravely. \u2018Simple, primitive, big\u2013that is Africa.\u2019",
        "I nodded appreciatively. \u2018You love it, don\u2019t you?\u2019 I asked. \u2018Yes.",
        "But to live in it long\u2013well, it makes one what you would call cruel.",
        "One comes to hold life and death very lightly.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 I said, thinking of Harry Rayburn.",
        "He had been like that too. \u2018But not cruel to weak things?\u2019 \u2018Opinions differ as to what are",
        "and are not \u201cweak things\u201d, Miss Anne.\u2019 There was a note of seriousness in his voice which almost",
        "startled me.",
        "I felt that I knew very little really of this man at my side. \u2018I meant children and",
        "dogs, I think.\u2019 \u2018I can truthfully say I\u2019ve never been cruel to children or dogs.",
        "So you don\u2019t class women as \u201cweak things\u201d?\u2019 I considered. \u2018No, I don\u2019t think I do\u2013though they are,",
        "I suppose.",
        "That is, they are nowadays.",
        "But Papa always said that in the beginning men and women roamed the world together, equal in strength\u2013like",
        "lions and tigers\u2013\u2019 \u2018And giraffes?\u2019 interpolated Colonel Race slyly.",
        "I laughed.",
        "Everyone makes fun of that giraffe. \u2018And giraffes.",
        "They were nomadic, you see.",
        "It wasn\u2019t till they settled down in communities, and women did one kind of thing and men another,",
        "that women got weak.",
        "And of course, underneath, one is still the same\u2013one feels the same, I mean\u2013and that is why women",
        "worship physical strength in men: it\u2019s what they once had and have lost.\u2019 \u2018Almost ancestor worship, in fact?\u2019",
        "\u2018Something of the kind.\u2019 \u2018And you really think that\u2019s true?",
        "That women worship strength, I mean?\u2019 \u2018I think it\u2019s quite true\u2013if one\u2019s honest.",
        "You think you admire moral qualities, but when you fall in love, you revert to the primitive where",
        "the physical is all that counts.",
        "But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the end; if you lived in primitive conditions it would be all right,",
        "but you don\u2019t\u2013and so, in the end, the other thing wins after all.",
        "It\u2019s the things that are apparently conquered that always do win, isn\u2019t it?",
        "They win in the only way that counts.",
        "Like what the Bible says about losing your life and finding it.\u2019 \u2018In the end,\u2019 said Colonel Race",
        "thoughtfully, \u2018you fall in love\u2013and you fall out of it, is that what you mean?\u2019 \u2018Not exactly, but",
        "you can put it that way if you like.\u2019 \u2018But I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever fallen out of",
        "love, Miss Anne?\u2019 \u2018No, I haven\u2019t,\u2019 I admitted frankly. \u2018Or fallen in love, either?\u2019 I did not answer.",
        "The car drew up at our destination and brought the conversation to a close.",
        "We got out and began the slow ascent to the World\u2019s View.",
        "Not for the first time, I felt a slight discomfort in Colonel Race\u2019s company.",
        "He veiled his thoughts so well behind those impenetrable black eyes.",
        "He frightened me a little.",
        "He had always frightened me.",
        "I never knew where I stood with him.",
        "We climbed in silence till we reached the spot where Rhodes lies guarded by giant boulders.",
        "A strange eerie place, far from the haunts of men, that sings a ceaseless paean of rugged beauty.",
        "We sat there for time in silence.",
        "Then descended once more, but diverging slightly from the path.",
        "Sometimes it was a rough scramble and once we came to a sharp slope or rock that was",
        "almost sheer.",
        "Colonel Race went first, then turned to help me. \u2018Better lift you,\u2019 he said suddenly, and swung me",
        "off my feet with a quick gesture.",
        "I felt the strength of him as he set me down and released his clasp.",
        "A man of iron, with muscles like taut steel.",
        "And again I felt afraid, especially as he did not move aside, but stood directly in front of",
        "me, staring into my face. \u2018What are you really doing here, Anne Beddingfeld?\u2019 he said abruptly. \u2018I\u2019m a",
        "gipsy seeing the world.\u2019 \u2018Yes, that\u2019s true enough.",
        "The newspaper correspondent is only a pretext.",
        "You\u2019ve not the soul of a journalist.",
        "You\u2019re out for your own hand\u2013snatching at life.",
        "But that\u2019s not all.\u2019 What was he going to make me tell him?",
        "I was afraid\u2013afraid.",
        "I looked him full in the face.",
        "My eyes can\u2019t keep secrets like his, but they can carry the war into the enemy\u2019s country. \u2018What",
        "are you really doing here, Colonel Race?\u2019 I asked deliberately.",
        "For a moment I thought he wasn\u2019t going to answer.",
        "He was clearly taken aback, though.",
        "At last he spoke, and his words seemed to afford him a grim amusement. \u2018Pursuing ambition,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Just that\u2013pursuing ambition.",
        "You will remember, Miss Beddingfeld, that \u201cby that sin fell the angels,\u201d etc.\u2019 \u2018They say,\u2019 I said slowly,",
        "\u2018that you are really connected with the Government\u2013that you are in the Secret Service.",
        "Is that true?\u2019 Was it my fancy, or did he hesitate for a fraction of a second before",
        "he answered? \u2018I can assure you, Miss Beddingfeld, that I am out here strictly as a private individual",
        "travelling for my own pleasure.\u2019 Thinking the answer over later, it struck me as slightly ambiguous.",
        "Perhaps he meant it to be so.",
        "We rejoined the car in silence.",
        "Half-way back to Bulawayo we stopped for tea at a somewhat primitive structure at the side of the",
        "road.",
        "The proprietor was digging in the garden, and seemed annoyed at being disturbed.",
        "But he graciously promised to see what he could do.",
        "After an interminable wait, he brought us some stale cakes and some lukewarm tea.",
        "Then disappeared to his garden again.",
        "No sooner had he departed than we were surrounded by cats, six of them all miaowing piteously at",
        "once.",
        "The racket was deafening.",
        "I offered them some pieces of cake.",
        "They devoured them ravenously.",
        "I poured all the milk there was into a saucer and they fought each other to get it.",
        "\u2018Oh,\u2019 I cried indignantly, \u2018they\u2019re starved!",
        "It\u2019s wicked.",
        "Please, please, order some more milk and another plate of cake.\u2019 Colonel Race departed silently to do my",
        "bidding.",
        "The cats had begun miaowing again.",
        "He returned with a big jug of milk and the cats finished it all.",
        "I got up with determination on my face. \u2018I\u2019m going to take those cats home with us\u2013I shan\u2019t",
        "leave them here.\u2019 \u2018My dear child, don\u2019t be absurd.",
        "You can\u2019t carry six cats as well as fifty wooden animals round with you.\u2019 \u2018Never mind the wooden",
        "animals.",
        "These cats are alive.",
        "I shall take them back with me.\u2019 \u2018You will do nothing of the kind.\u2019 I looked at him",
        "resentfully but he went on: \u2018You think me cruel\u2013but one can\u2019t go through life sentimentalizing over these things.",
        "It\u2019s no good standing out\u2013I shan\u2019t allow you to take them.",
        "It\u2019s a primitive country, you know, and I\u2019m stronger than you.\u2019 I always know when I am beaten.",
        "I went down to the car with tears in my eyes. \u2018They\u2019re probably short of food just today,\u2019",
        "he explained consolingly. \u2018That man\u2019s wife has gone into Bulawayo for stores.",
        "So it will be all right.",
        "And anyway, you know, the world\u2019s full of starving cats.\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t\u2013don\u2019t,\u2019 I said fiercely. \u2018I\u2019m teaching you to",
        "realize life as it is.",
        "I\u2019m teaching you to be hard and ruthless\u2013like I am.",
        "That\u2019s the secret of strength\u2013and the secret of success.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019d sooner be dead than hard,\u2019 I said passionately.",
        "We got into the car and started off.",
        "I pulled myself together again slowly.",
        "Suddenly, to my intense astonishment, he took my hand in his. \u2018Anne,\u2019 he said gently, \u2018I want you.",
        "Will you marry me?\u2019 I was utterly taken aback. \u2018Oh, no,\u2019 I stammered. \u2018I can\u2019t.\u2019 \u2018Why not?\u2019 \u2018I",
        "don\u2019t care for you in that way.",
        "I\u2019ve never thought of you like that.\u2019 \u2018I see.",
        "Is that the only reason?\u2019 I had to be honest.",
        "I owed it him. \u2018No,\u2019 I said, \u2018it is not.",
        "You see\u2013I\u2013care for someone else.\u2019 \u2018I see,\u2019 he said again. \u2018And was that true at the beginning\u2013when I",
        "first saw you\u2013on the Kilmorden? \u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 I whispered. \u2018It was\u2013since then.\u2019 \u2018I see,\u2019 he said for the",
        "third time, but this time there was a purposeful ring in his voice that made me turn and",
        "look at him.",
        "His face was grimmer than I had ever seen it. \u2018What\u2013what do you mean?\u2019 I faltered.",
        "He looked at me, inscrutable, dominating. \u2018Only\u2013that I know now what I have to do.\u2019 His words sent",
        "a shiver through me.",
        "There was a determination behind them that I did not understand\u2013and it frightened me.",
        "We neither of us said any more until we got back to the hotel.",
        "I went straight up to Suzanne.",
        "She was lying on her bed reading, and did not look in the least as though she had",
        "a headache. \u2018Here reposes the perfect gooseberry,\u2019 she remarked. \u2018 Alias the tactful chaperone.",
        "Why, Anne dear, what\u2019s the matter?\u2019 For I had burst into a flood of tears.",
        "I told her about the cats\u2013I felt it wasn\u2019t fair to tell her about Colonel Race.",
        "But Suzanne is very sharp.",
        "I think she saw that there was something more behind. \u2018You haven\u2019t caught a chill, have you, Anne?",
        "Sounds absurd even to suggest such things in this heat, but you keep on shivering.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s nothing,\u2019 I",
        "said. \u2018Nerves\u2013or someone walking over my grave.",
        "I keep feeling something dreadful\u2019s going to happen.\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t be silly,\u2019 said Suzanne, with decision. \u2018Let\u2019s talk of",
        "something interesting.",
        "Anne, about those diamonds\u2013\u2019 \u2018What about them?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m not sure they\u2019re safe with me.",
        "It was all right before, no one could think they\u2019d be amongst my things.",
        "But now that everyone knows we\u2019re such friends, you and I, I\u2019ll be under suspicion too.\u2019 \u2018Nobody knows",
        "they\u2019re in a roll of films, though,\u2019 I argued. \u2018It\u2019s a splendid hiding-place and I really don\u2019t think",
        "we could better it.\u2019 She agreed doubtfully, but said we would discuss it again when we got to",
        "the Falls.",
        "Our train went at nine o\u2019clock.",
        "Sir Eustace\u2019s temper was still far from good, and Miss Pettigrew looked subdued.",
        "Colonel Race was completely himself.",
        "I felt that I had dreamed the whole conversation on the way back.",
        "I slept heavily that night on my hard bunk, struggling with ill-defined, menacing dreams.",
        "I awoke with a headache and went out on the observation platform of the car.",
        "It was fresh and lovely, and everywhere, as far as one could see, were the undulating wooded hills.",
        "I loved it\u2013loved it more than any place I had ever seen.",
        "I wished then that I could have a little hut somewhere in the heart of the scrub and",
        "live there always\u2013always\u2026 Just before half-past two, Colonel Race called me out from the \u2018office\u2019 and pointed to",
        "a bouquet-shaped white mist that hovered over one portion of the bush. \u2018The spray from the Falls,\u2019 he",
        "said. \u2018We are nearly there.\u2019 I was still wrapped in that strange dream feeling of exaltation that had",
        "succeeded my troubled night.",
        "Very strongly implanted in me was the feeling that I had come home\u2026Home!",
        "And yet I had never been here before\u2013or had I in dreams?",
        "We walked from the train to the hotel, a big white building closely wired against mosquitoes.",
        "There were no roads, no houses.",
        "We went out on the stoep and I uttered a gasp.",
        "There, half a mile away, facing us, were the Falls.",
        "I\u2019ve never seen anything so grand and beautiful\u2013I never shall. \u2018Anne, you\u2019re fey,\u2019 said Suzanne, as we sat",
        "down to lunch. \u2018I\u2019ve never seen you like this before.\u2019 She stared at me curiously. \u2018Am I?\u2019 I",
        "laughed, but I felt that my laugh was unnatural. \u2018It\u2019s just that I love it all.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s more",
        "than that.\u2019 A little frown crossed her brow\u2013one of apprehension.",
        "Yes, I was happy, but beyond that I had the curious feeling that I was waiting for something\u2013something",
        "that would happen soon.",
        "I was excited\u2013restless.",
        "After tea we strolled out, got on the trolley and were pushed by smiling blacks down the little",
        "tracks of rails to the bridge.",
        "It was a marvellous sight, the great chasm and the rushing waters below, and the veil of mist",
        "and spray in front of us that parted every now and then for one brief minute to show",
        "the cataract of water and then closed up again in its impenetrable mystery.",
        "That, to my mind, has always been the fascination of the Falls\u2013their elusive quality.",
        "You always think you\u2019re going to see\u2013and you never do.",
        "We crossed the bridge and walked slowly on by the path that was marked out with white stone",
        "on either side and led round the brink of the gorge.",
        "Finally we arrived in a big clearing where on the left a path led downwards towards the chasm.",
        "\u2018The palm gully,\u2019 explained Colonel Race. \u2018Shall we go down?",
        "Or shall we leave it until tomorrow?",
        "It will take some time, and it\u2019s a good climb up again.\u2019 \u2018We\u2019ll leave it until tomorrow,\u2019 said",
        "Sir Eustace with decision.",
        "He isn\u2019t at all fond of strenuous physical exercise, I have noticed.",
        "He led the way back.",
        "As we went, we passed a fine native stalking along.",
        "Behind him came a woman who seemed to have the entire household belongings piled upon her head!",
        "The collection included a frying-pan. \u2018I never have my camera when I want it,\u2019 groaned Suzanne. \u2018That\u2019s an",
        "opportunity that will occur often enough, Mrs Blair,\u2019 said Colonel Race. \u2018So don\u2019t lament.\u2019 We arrived back on",
        "the bridge. \u2018Shall we go into the rainbow forest?\u2019 he continued. \u2018Or are you afraid of getting wet?\u2019",
        "Suzanne and I accompanied him.",
        "Sir Eustace went back to the hotel.",
        "I was rather disappointed in the rainbow forest.",
        "There weren\u2019t nearly enough rainbows, and we got soaked to the skin, but every now and then we",
        "got a glimpse of the Falls opposite and realized how enormously wide they are.",
        "Oh, dear, dear Falls, how I love and worship you and always shall!",
        "We got back to the hotel just in time to change for dinner.",
        "Sir Eustace seems to have taken a positive antipathy to Colonel Race.",
        "Suzanne and I rallied him gently, but didn\u2019t get much satisfaction.",
        "After dinner he retired to his sitting-room, dragging Miss Pettigrew with him.",
        "Suzanne and I talked for a while with Colonel Race, and then she declared, with an immense yawn,",
        "that she was going to bed.",
        "I didn\u2019t want to be left alone with him, so I got up too and went to my",
        "room.",
        "But I was far too excited to go to sleep.",
        "I did not even undress.",
        "I lay back in a chair and gave myself up to dreaming.",
        "And all the time I was conscious of something coming nearer and nearer\u2026 There was a knock at",
        "the door, and I started.",
        "I got up and went to it.",
        "A little black boy held out a note.",
        "It was addressed to me in a handwriting I did not know.",
        "I took it and came back into the room.",
        "I stood there holding it.",
        "At last I opened it.",
        "It was very short! \u2018I must see you.",
        "I dare not come to the hotel.",
        "Will you come to the clearing by the palm gully?",
        "In memory of Cabin 17 please come.",
        "The man you knew as Harry Rayburn.\u2019 My heart beat to suffocation.",
        "He was here then!",
        "Oh, I had known it\u2013I had known it all along!",
        "I had felt him near me.",
        "All unwittingly I had come to his place of retreat.",
        "I wound a scarf round my head and stole to the door.",
        "I must be careful.",
        "He was hunted down.",
        "No one must see me meet him.",
        "I stole along to Suzanne\u2019s room.",
        "She was fast asleep.",
        "I could hear her breathing evenly.",
        "Sir Eustace?",
        "I paused outside the door of his sitting-room.",
        "Yes, he was dictating to Miss Pettigrew, I could hear her monotonous voice repeating: \u2018I therefore venture to",
        "suggest, that in tackling this problem of coloured labour\u2013\u2019 She paused for him to continue, and I heard",
        "him grunt something angrily.",
        "I stole on again.",
        "Colonel Race\u2019s room was empty.",
        "I did not see him in the lounge.",
        "And he was the man I feared most!",
        "Still, I could waste no more time.",
        "I slipped quickly out of the hotel, and took the path to the bridge.",
        "I crossed it and stood there waiting in the shadow.",
        "If anyone had followed me, I should see them crossing the bridge.",
        "But the minutes passed, and no one came.",
        "I had not been followed.",
        "I turned and took the path to the clearing.",
        "I took six paces or so, and then stopped.",
        "Something had rustled behind me.",
        "It could not be anyone who had followed me from the hotel.",
        "It was someone who was already here, waiting.",
        "And immediately, without rhyme or reason, but with the sureness of instinct, I knew that it was I",
        "myself who was threatened.",
        "It was the same feeling as I had had on the Kilmorden that night\u2013a sure instinct warning me",
        "of danger.",
        "I looked sharply over my shoulder.",
        "Silence.",
        "I moved on a pace or two.",
        "Again I heard that rustle.",
        "Still walking, I looked over my shoulder again.",
        "A man\u2019s figure came out of the shadow.",
        "He saw that I saw him, and jumped forward, hard on my track.",
        "It was too dark to recognize anybody.",
        "All I could see was that he was tall, and a European, not a native.",
        "I took to my heels and ran.",
        "I heard him pounding behind.",
        "I ran quicker, keeping my eyes fixed on the white stones that showed me where to step, for",
        "there was no moon that night.",
        "And suddenly my foot felt nothingness.",
        "I heard the man behind me laugh, an evil, sinister laugh.",
        "It rang in my ears, as I fell headlong\u2013down\u2013down\u2013down to destruction far beneath.",
        "Chapter 25 I came to myself slowly and painfully.",
        "I was conscious of an aching head and a shooting pain down my left arm when I tried",
        "to move, and everything seemed dreamlike and unreal.",
        "Nightmare visions floated before me.",
        "I felt myself falling\u2013falling again.",
        "Once Harry Rayburn\u2019s face seemed to come to me out of the mist.",
        "Almost I imagined it real.",
        "Then it floated away again, mocking me.",
        "Once, I remember, someone put a cup to my lips and I drank.",
        "A black face grinned into mine\u2013a devil\u2019s face, I thought it, and screamed out.",
        "Then dreams again\u2013long troubled dreams in which I vainly sought Harry Rayburn to warn him\u2013warn him\u2013what of?",
        "I did not know myself.",
        "But there was some danger\u2013some great danger\u2013and I alone could save him.",
        "Then darkness again, merciful darkness and real sleep.",
        "I woke at last myself again.",
        "The long nightmare was over.",
        "I remembered perfectly everything that had happened: my hurried flight from the hotel to meet Harry, the man",
        "in the shadows and the last terrible moment of falling\u2026 By some miracle or other I had not",
        "been killed.",
        "I was bruised and aching, and very weak, but I was alive.",
        "But where was I?",
        "Moving my head with difficulty I looked round me.",
        "I was in a small room with rough wooden walls.",
        "On them were huge skins of animals and various tusks of ivory.",
        "I was lying on a kind of rough couch, also covered with skins, and my left arm was",
        "bandaged up and felt stiff and uncomfortable.",
        "At first I thought I was alone, and then I saw a man\u2019s figure sitting between me and",
        "the light, his head turned towards the window.",
        "He was so still that he might have been carved out of wood.",
        "Something in the close-cropped black head was familiar to me, but I did not dare to let my",
        "imagination run astray.",
        "Suddenly he turned, and I caught my breath.",
        "It was Harry Rayburn.",
        "Harry Rayburn in the flesh.",
        "He rose and came over to me. \u2018Feeling better?\u2019 he said a trifle awkwardly.",
        "I could not answer.",
        "The tears were running down my face.",
        "I was weak still, but I held his hand in both of mine.",
        "If only I could die like this, whilst he stood there looking down on me with that new",
        "look in his eyes. \u2018Don\u2019t cry, Anne.",
        "Please don\u2019t cry.",
        "You\u2019re safe now.",
        "No one shall hurt you.\u2019 He went and fetched a cup and brought it to me. \u2018Drink some",
        "of this milk.\u2019 I drank obediently.",
        "He went on talking, in a low coaxing tone such as he might have used to a child.",
        "\u2018Don\u2019t ask any more questions now.",
        "Go to sleep again.",
        "You\u2019ll be stronger by and by.",
        "I\u2019ll go away if you like.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 I said urgently. \u2018No, no.\u2019 \u2018Then I\u2019ll stay.\u2019 He brought a",
        "small stool over beside me and sat there.",
        "He laid his hand over mine, and, soothed and comforted, I dropped off to sleep once more.",
        "It must have been evening then, but when I woke again the sun was high in the heavens.",
        "I was alone in the hut, but as I stirred an old native woman came running in.",
        "She was hideous as sin, but she grinned at me encouragingly.",
        "She brought me water in a basin and helped me wash my face and hands.",
        "Then she brought me a large bowl of soup, and I finished it every drop!",
        "I asked her several questions, but she only grinned and nodded and chattered away in a guttural language,",
        "so I gathered she knew no English.",
        "Suddenly she stood up and drew back respectfully as Harry Rayburn entered.",
        "He gave her a nod of dismissal and she went out leaving us alone.",
        "He smiled at me. \u2018Really better today!\u2019 \u2018Yes, indeed, but very bewildered still.",
        "Where am I?\u2019 \u2018You\u2019re on a small island on the Zambesi about four miles up from the Falls.\u2019",
        "\u2018Do\u2013do my friends know I\u2019m here?\u2019 He shook his head. \u2018I must send word to them.\u2019 \u2018That is",
        "as you like, of course, but if I were you I should wait until you are a little",
        "stronger.\u2019 \u2018Why?\u2019 He did not answer immediately, so I went on: \u2018How long have I been here?\u2019 His",
        "answer amazed me. \u2018Nearly a month.\u2019 \u2018Oh!\u2019 I cried. \u2018I must send word to Suzanne.",
        "She\u2019ll be terribly anxious.\u2019 \u2018Who is Suzanne?\u2019 \u2018Mrs Blair.",
        "I was with her and Sir Eustace and Colonel Race at the hotel\u2013but you knew that, surely?\u2019 He",
        "shook his head. \u2018I know nothing, except that I found you, caught in the fork of a tree,",
        "unconscious and with a badly wrenched arm.\u2019 \u2018Where was the tree?\u2019 \u2018Overhanging the ravine.",
        "But for your clothes catching on the branches, you would certainly have been dashed to pieces.\u2019 I shuddered.",
        "Then a thought struck me. \u2018You say you didn\u2019t know I was there.",
        "What about the note then?\u2019 \u2018What note?\u2019 \u2018The note you sent me, asking me to meet you in",
        "the clearing.\u2019 He stared at me. \u2018I sent no note.\u2019 I felt myself flushing up to the roots",
        "of my hair.",
        "Fortunately he did not seem to notice. \u2018How did you come to be on the spot in such",
        "a marvellous manner?\u2019 I asked, in as nonchalant a manner as I could assume. \u2018And what are you",
        "doing in this part of the world, anyway?\u2019 \u2018I live here,\u2019 he said simply. \u2018On this island?\u2019 \u2018Yes,",
        "I came here after the War.",
        "Sometimes I take parties from the hotel out in my boat, but it costs me very little to",
        "live, and mostly I do as I please.\u2019 \u2018You live here all alone?\u2019 \u2018I am not pining for",
        "society, I assure you,\u2019 he replied coldly. \u2018I am sorry to have inflicted mine upon you,\u2019 I retorted,",
        "\u2018but I seem to have had very little to say in the matter.\u2019 To my surprise, his eyes",
        "twinkled a little. \u2018None whatever.",
        "I slung you across my shoulders like a sack of coal and carried you to my boat.",
        "Quite like a primitive man of the Stone Age.\u2019 \u2018But for a different reason,\u2019 I put in.",
        "He flushed this time, a deep burning blush.",
        "The tan of his face was suffused. \u2018But you haven\u2019t told me how you came to be wandering",
        "about so conveniently for me?\u2019 I said hastily, to cover his confusion. \u2018I couldn\u2019t sleep.",
        "I was restless\u2013disturbed\u2013had the feeling something was going to happen.",
        "In the end I took the boat and came ashore and tramped down towards the Falls.",
        "I was just at the head of the palm gully when I heard you scream.\u2019 \u2018Why didn\u2019t you",
        "get help from the hotel instead of carting me all the way here?\u2019 I asked.",
        "He flushed again. \u2018I suppose it seems an unpardonable liberty to you\u2013but I don\u2019t think that even now",
        "you realize your danger!",
        "You think I should have informed your friends?",
        "Pretty friends, who allowed you to be decoyed out to death.",
        "No, I swore to myself that I\u2019d take better care of you than anyone else could.",
        "Not a soul comes to this island.",
        "I got old Batani, whom I cured of a fever once, to come and look after you.",
        "She\u2019s loyal.",
        "She\u2019ll never say a word.",
        "I could keep you here for months and no one would ever know.\u2019 I could keep you here",
        "for months and no one would ever know!",
        "How some words please one! \u2018You did quite right,\u2019 I said quietly. \u2018And I shall not send word",
        "to anyone.",
        "A day or so more anxiety doesn\u2019t make much difference.",
        "It\u2019s not as though they were my own people.",
        "They\u2019re only acquaintances really\u2013even Suzanne.",
        "And whoever wrote that note must have known\u2013a great deal!",
        "It was not the work of an outsider.\u2019 I managed to mention the note this time without blushing",
        "at all. \u2018If you would be guided by me\u2013\u2019 he said, hesitating. \u2018I don\u2019t expect I shall be,\u2019",
        "I answered candidly. \u2018But there\u2019s no harm in hearing.\u2019 \u2018Do you always do what you like, Miss Beddingfeld?\u2019",
        "\u2018Usually,\u2019 I replied cautiously.",
        "To anyone else I would have said \u2018Always.\u2019 \u2018I pity your husband,\u2019 he said unexpectedly. \u2018You needn\u2019t,\u2019 I",
        "retorted. \u2018I shouldn\u2019t dream of marrying anyone unless I was madly in love with him.",
        "And of course there is really nothing a woman enjoys so much as doing all the things she",
        "doesn\u2019t like for the sake of someone she does like.",
        "And the more self-willed she is, the more she likes it.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m afraid I disagree with you.",
        "The boot is on the other leg as a rule.\u2019 He spoke with a slight sneer. \u2018Exactly,\u2019 I",
        "cried eagerly. \u2018And that\u2019s why there are so many unhappy marriages.",
        "It\u2019s all the fault of the men.",
        "Either they give way to their women\u2013and then the women despise them\u2013or else they are utterly selfish, insist",
        "on their own way and never say \u201cthank you\u201d.",
        "Successful husbands make their wives do just what they want, and then make a frightful fuss of them",
        "for doing it.",
        "Women like to be mastered, but they hate not to have their sacrifices appreciated.",
        "On the other hand, men don\u2019t really appreciate women who are nice to them all the time.",
        "When I am married, I shall be a devil most of the time, but every now and then,",
        "when my husband least expects it, I shall show him what a perfect angel I can be.\u2019 Harry",
        "laughed outright. \u2018What a cat-and-dog life you will lead!\u2019 \u2018Lovers always fight,\u2019 I assured him. \u2018Because they don\u2019t",
        "understand each other.",
        "And by the time they do understand each other they aren\u2019t in love any more.\u2019 \u2018Does the reverse",
        "hold true?",
        "Are people who fight each other always lovers?\u2019 \u2018I\u2013I don\u2019t know,\u2019 I said, momentarily confused.",
        "He turned away to the fireplace. \u2018Like some more soup?\u2019 he asked in a casual tone. \u2018Yes, please.",
        "I\u2019m so hungry that I would eat a hippopotamus.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s good.\u2019 He busied himself with the fire, I",

        "to take you back to England.\u2019 \u2018That would be very tame,\u2019 I objected scornfully. \u2018There speaks a foolish",
        "schoolgirl.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m not a foolish schoolgirl,\u2019 I cried indignantly. \u2018I\u2019m a woman.\u2019 He looked at me with an",
        "expression I could not fathom, as I sat up flushed and excited. \u2018God help me, so you are,\u2019",
        "he muttered and went abruptly out.",
        "My recovery was rapid.",
        "The two injuries I had sustained were a knock on the head and a badly wrenched arm.",
        "The latter was the most serious and, to begin with, my rescuer had believed it to be actually",
        "broken.",
        "A careful examination, however, convinced him that it was not so, and although it was very painful I",
        "was recovering the use of it quite quickly.",
        "It was a strange time.",
        "We were cut off from the world, alone together as Adam and Eve might have been\u2013but with what",
        "a difference!",

        "the shade of the palms, talking and quarrelling\u2013discussing everything under high heaven, quarrelling and making it up again.",
        "We bickered a good deal, but there grew up between us a real and lasting comradeship such as",
        "I could never have believed possible.",
        "That\u2013and something else.",
        "The time was drawing near, I knew it, when I should be well enough to leave, and I",
        "realized it with a heavy heart.",
        "Was he going to let me go?",
        "Without a word?",
        "Without a sign?",
        "He had fits of silence, long moody intervals, moments when he would spring up and tramp off by",
        "himself.",
        "One evening the crisis came.",
        "We had finished our simple meal and were sitting in the doorway of the hut.",
        "The sun was sinking.",
        "Hairpins were necessities of life with which Harry had not been able to provide me, and my hair,",
        "straight and black, hung to my knees.",
        "I sat, my chin on my hands, lost in meditation.",
        "I felt rather than saw Harry looking at me. \u2018You look like a witch, Anne,\u2019 he said at",

        "it?\u2019 \u2018Happy?",
        "It\u2019s been hell!\u2019 \u2018As bad as that!\u2019 \u2018What do you torment me for?",

        "You\u2019re so young, Anne, and so beautiful\u2013with the kind of beauty that sends men mad.",
        "All the world\u2019s before you\u2013love, life, everything.",
        "Mine\u2019s behind me\u2013scorched, spoiled, with a taste of bitter ashes.\u2019 \u2018If you don\u2019t want me\u2013\u2019 \u2018You know I",

        "You shall go tonight.",
        "You shall go to Beira\u2013\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m not going to Beira,\u2019 I interrupted. \u2018You are.",
        "You shall go to Beira if I have to take you there myself and throw you on to",

        "Do you think I\u2019ll wake up night after night, fearing they\u2019ve got you?",
        "One can\u2019t go on counting on miracles happening.",
        "You must go back to England, Anne\u2013and\u2013and marry and be happy.\u2019 \u2018With a steady man who\u2019ll give me",
        "a good home!\u2019 \u2018Better that than\u2013utter disaster.\u2019 \u2018And what of you?\u2019 His face grew grim and set. \u2018I\u2019ve",

        "You can guess, I dare say.",

        "fair,\u2019 I said. \u2018He didn\u2019t actually push me over.\u2019 \u2018He\u2019d no need to.",
        "His plan was cleverer than that.",
        "I went up to the path afterwards.",
        "Everything looked all right, but by the marks on the ground I saw that the stones which outline",
        "the path had been taken up and put down again in a slightly different place.",
        "There are tall bushes growing just over the edge.",
        "He\u2019d balanced the outside stones on them, so that you\u2019d think you were still on the path when",
        "in reality you were stepping into nothingness.",
        "God help him if I lay my hands upon him!\u2019 He paused a minute and then said, in",
        "a totally different tone: \u2018We\u2019ve never spoken of these things, Anne, have we?",
        "But the time\u2019s come.",
        "I want you to hear the whole story\u2013from the beginning.\u2019 \u2018If it hurts you to go over the",
        "past, don\u2019t tell me,\u2019 I said in a low voice. \u2018But I want you to know.",
        "I never thought I should speak of that part of my life to anyone.",
        "Funny, isn\u2019t it, the tricks Fate plays?\u2019 He was silent for a minute or two.",
        "The sun had set, and the velvety darkness of the African night was enveloping us like a mantle.",
        "\u2018Some of it I know,\u2019 I said gently. \u2018What do you know?\u2019 \u2018I know that your real name",
        "is Harry Lucas.\u2019 Still he hesitated\u2013not looking at me, but staring straight out in front of him.",
        "I had no clue as to what was passing in his mind, but at last he jerked his",
        "head forward as though acquiescing in some unspoken decision of his own, and began his story.",
        "Chapter 26 \u2018You are right.",
        "My real name is Harry Lucas.",
        "My father was a retired soldier who came out to farm in Rhodesia.",
        "He died when I was in my second year at Cambridge.\u2019 \u2018Were you fond of him?\u2019 I asked",
        "suddenly. \u2018I\u2013don\u2019t know.\u2019 Then he flushed and went on with sudden vehemence: \u2018Why do I say that?",
        "I did love my father.",
        "We said bitter things to each other the last time I saw him, and we had many rows",
        "over my wildness and my debts, but I cared for the old man.",
        "I know how much now\u2013when it\u2019s too late,\u2019 he continued more quietly. \u2018It was at Cambridge that I",
        "met the other fellow\u2013\u2019 \u2018Young Eardsley?\u2019 \u2018Yes\u2013young Eardsley.",
        "His father, as you know, was one of South Africa\u2019s most prominent men.",
        "We drifted together at once, my friend and I.",
        "We had our love of South Africa in common and we both had a taste for the untrodden",
        "places of the world.",
        "After he left Cambridge, Eardsley had a final quarrel with his father.",
        "The old man had paid his debts twice, he refused to do so again.",
        "There was a bitter scene between them.",
        "Sir Laurence declared himself at the end of his patience\u2013he would do no more for his son.",
        "He must stand on his own legs for a while.",
        "The result was, as you know, that those two young men went off to South America together, prospecting",
        "for diamonds.",
        "I\u2019m not going into that now, but we had a wonderful time out there.",
        "Hardships in plenty, you understand, but it was a good life\u2013a hand-to-mouth scramble for existence far from the",
        "beaten track\u2013and, my God that\u2019s the place to know a friend.",
        "There was a bond forged between us two out there that only death could have broken.",
        "Well, as Colonel Race told you, our efforts were crowned with success.",
        "We found a second Kimberley in the heart of the British Guiana jungles.",
        "I can\u2019t tell you our elation.",
        "It wasn\u2019t so much the actual value in money of the find\u2013you see, Eardsley was used to money,",
        "and he knew that when his father died he would be a millionaire, and Lucas had always been",
        "poor and was used to it.",
        "No, it was the sheer delight of discovery.\u2019 He paused, and then added, almost apologetically. \u2018You don\u2019t mind",
        "my telling it this way, do you?",
        "As though I wasn\u2019t in it at all.",
        "It seems like that now when I look back and see those two boys.",
        "I almost forget that one of them was\u2013Harry Rayburn.\u2019 \u2018Tell it any way you like,\u2019 I said, and",
        "he went on: \u2018We came to Kimberley\u2013very cock-a-hoop over our find.",
        "We brought a magnificent selection of diamonds with us to submit to the experts.",
        "And then\u2013in the hotel at Kimberley\u2013we met her\u2013\u2019 I stiffened a little, and the hand that rested on",
        "the door-post clenched itself involuntarily. \u2018Anita Gr\u00fcnberg\u2013that was her name.",
        "She was an actress.",
        "Quite young and very beautiful.",
        "She was South African born, but her mother was a Hungarian, I believe.",
        "There was some sort of mystery about her, and that, of course, heightened her attraction for two boys",
        "home from the wilds.",
        "She must have had an easy task.",
        "We both fell for her right away, and we both took it hard.",
        "It was the first shadow that had ever come between us\u2013but even then it didn\u2019t weaken our friendship.",
        "Each of us, I honestly believe, was willing to stand aside for the other to go in and",
        "win.",
        "But that wasn\u2019t her game.",
        "Sometimes, afterwards, I wondered why it hadn\u2019t been, for Sir Laurence Eardsley\u2019s only son was quite a parti .",
        "But the truth of it was that she was married\u2013to a sorter in De Beers\u2013though nobody knew of",
        "it.",
        "She pretended enormous interest in our discovery, and we told her all about it and even showed her",
        "the diamonds.",
        "Delilah\u2013that\u2019s what she should have been called\u2013and she played her part well! \u2018The De Beers robbery was discovered,",
        "and like a thunderclap the police came down upon us.",
        "They seized our diamonds.",
        "We only laughed at first\u2013the whole thing was so absurd.",
        "And then the diamonds were produced in court\u2013and without question they were the stones stolen from De Beers.",
        "Anita Gr\u00fcnberg had disappeared.",
        "She had effected the substitution neatly enough, and our story that these were not the stones originally in",
        "our possession was laughed to scorn. \u2018Sir Laurence Eardsley had enormous influence.",
        "He succeeded in getting the case dismissed\u2013but it left two young men ruined and disgraced to face the",
        "world with the stigma of thief attached to their name, and it pretty well broke the old fellow\u2019s",
        "heart.",
        "He had one bitter interview with his son in which he heaped upon him every reproach imaginable.",
        "He had done what he could to save the family name, but from that day on his son",
        "was his son no longer.",
        "He cast him off utterly.",
        "And the boy, like the proud young fool that he was, remained silent, disdaining to protest his innocence",
        "in the face of his father\u2019s disbelief.",
        "He came out furious from the interview\u2013his friend was waiting for him.",
        "A week later, war was declared.",
        "The two friends enlisted together.",
        "You know what happened.",
        "The best pal a man ever had was killed, partly through his own mad recklessness in rushing into",
        "unnecessary danger.",
        "He died with his name tarnished\u2026 \u2018I swear to you, Anne, that it was mainly on his account",
        "that I was so bitter against that woman.",
        "It had gone deeper with him than with me.",
        "I had been madly in love with her for the moment\u2013I even think that I frightened her sometimes\u2013but",
        "with him it was a quieter and deeper feeling.",
        "She had been the very centre of his universe\u2013and her betrayal of him tore up the very roots",
        "of life.",
        "The blow stunned him and left him paralysed.\u2019 Harry paused.",
        "After a minute or two he went on: \u2018As you know, I was reported \u201cMissing, presumed killed\u201d.",
        "I never troubled to correct the mistake.",
        "I took the name of Parker and came to this island, which I knew of old.",
        "At the beginning of the War I had had ambitious hopes of proving my innocence, but now all",
        "that spirit seemed dead.",
        "All I felt was, \u201cWhat\u2019s the good?\u201d My pal was dead, neither he nor I had any living",
        "relations who would care.",
        "I was supposed to be dead too; let it remain at that.",
        "I led a peaceful existence here, neither happy nor unhappy\u2013numbed of all feeling.",
        "I see now, though I did not realize it at the time, that that was partly the effect",
        "of the War. \u2018And then one day something occurred to wake me right up again.",
        "I was taking a party of people in my boat on a trip up the river, and I",
        "was standing at the landing-stage, helping them in, when one of the men uttered a startled exclamation.",
        "It focused my attention on him.",
        "He was a small, thin man with a beard, and he was staring at me for all he",
        "was worth as though I was a ghost.",
        "So powerful was his emotion that it awakened my curiosity.",
        "I made inquiries about him at the hotel and learned that his name was Carton, that he came",
        "from Kimberley, and that he was a diamond-sorter employed by De Beers.",
        "In a minute all the old sense of wrong surged over me again.",
        "I left the island and went to Kimberley. \u2018I could find out little more about him, however.",
        "In the end, I decided that I must force an interview.",
        "I took my revolver with me.",
        "In the brief glimpse I had had of him, I had realized that he was a physical coward.",
        "No sooner were we face to face than I recognized that he was afraid of me.",
        "I soon forced him to tell me all he knew.",
        "He had engineered part of the robbery and Anita Gr\u00fcnberg was his wife.",
        "He had once caught sight of both of us when we were dining with her at the hotel,",
        "and, having read that I was killed, my appearance in the flesh at the Falls had startled him",
        "badly.",
        "He and Anita had married quite young, but she had soon drifted away from him.",
        "She had got in with a bad lot, he told me\u2013and it was then for the first time",
        "that I heard of the \u201cColonel\u201d.",
        "Carton himself had never been mixed up in anything except this one affair\u2013so he solemnly assured me, and",
        "I was inclined to believe him.",
        "He was emphatically not of the stuff of which successful criminals are made. \u2018I still had the feeling",
        "that he was keeping back something.",
        "As a test, I threatened to shoot him there and then, declaring that I cared very little what",
        "became of me now.",
        "In a frenzy of terror he poured out a further story.",
        "It seems that Anita Gr\u00fcnberg did not quite trust the \u201cColonel\u201d.",
        "Whilst pretending to hand over to him the stones she had taken from the hotel, she kept back",
        "some in her own possession.",
        "Carton advised her, with his technical knowledge, which to keep.",
        "If, at any time, these stones were produced, they were of such colour and quality as to be",
        "readily identifiable, and the experts at De Beers would admit at once that these stones had never passed",
        "through their hands.",
        "In this way, my story of a substitution would be supported, my name would be cleared, and suspicion",
        "would be diverted to the proper quarter.",
        "I gathered that, contrary to his usual practice, the \u201cColonel\u201d himself had been concerned in this affair, therefore",
        "Anita felt satisfied that she had a real hold over him, should she need it.",
        "Carton now proposed that I should make a bargain with Anita Gr\u00fcnberg, or Nadina, as she now called",
        "herself.",
        "For a sufficient sum of money, he thought that she would be willing to give up the diamonds",
        "and betray her former employer.",
        "He would cable to her immediately. \u2018I was still suspicious of Carton.",
        "He was a man whom it was easy enough to frighten, but who, in his fright, would tell",
        "so many lies that to sift the truth out from them would be no easy job.",
        "I went back to the hotel and waited.",
        "By the following evening I judged that he would have received the reply to his cable.",
        "I called round to his house and was told that Mr Carton was away, but would be returning",
        "on the morrow.",
        "Instantly I became suspicious.",
        "In the nick of time I found out that he was in reality sailing for England on the",
        "Kilmorden Castle , which left Cape Town in two days\u2019 time.",
        "I had just time to journey down and catch the same boat. \u2018I had no intention of alarming",
        "Carton by revealing my presence on board.",
        "I had done a good deal of acting in my time at Cambridge, and it was comparatively easy",
        "for me to transform myself into a grave bearded gentleman of middle age.",
        "I avoided Carton carefully on board the boat, keeping to my own cabin as far as possible under",
        "the pretence of illness. \u2018I had no difficulty in trailing him when we got to London.",
        "He went straight to an hotel and did not go out until the following day.",
        "He left the hotel shortly before one o\u2019clock.",
        "I was behind him.",
        "He went straight to a house-agent in Knightsbridge.",
        "There he asked for particulars of houses to let on the river. \u2018I was at the next table",
        "also inquiring about houses.",
        "Then suddenly in walked Anita Gr\u00fcnberg, Nadina\u2013whatever you like to call her.",
        "Superb, insolent, and almost as beautiful as ever.",
        "God! how I hated her.",
        "There she was, the woman who had ruined my life\u2013and who had also ruined a better life than",
        "mine.",
        "At that minute I could have put my hands round her neck and squeezed the life out of",
        "her inch by inch!",
        "Just for a minute or two I saw red.",
        "I hardly took in what the agent was saying.",
        "It was her voice that I heard next, high and clear, with an exaggerated foreign accent: \u201cThe Mill",
        "House, Marlow.",
        "The property of Sir Eustace Pedler.",
        "That sounds as though it might suit me.",
        "At any rate, I will go and see it.\u2019 \u2018The man wrote her an order, and she walked",
        "out again in her regal insolent manner.",
        "Not by word or a sign had she recognized Carton, yet I was sure that their meeting there",
        "was a preconceived plan.",
        "Then I started to jump to conclusions.",
        "Not knowing that Sir Eustace was at Cannes, I thought that this house-hunting business was a mere pretext",
        "for meeting him in the Mill House.",
        "I knew that he had been in South Africa at the time of the robbery, and never having",
        "seen him I immediately leaped to the conclusion that he himself was the mysterious \u201cColonel\u201d of whom I",
        "had heard so much. \u2018I followed my two suspects along Knightsbridge.",
        "Nadina went into the Hyde Park Hotel.",
        "I quickened my pace and went in also.",
        "She walked straight into the restaurant, and I decided that I would not risk her recognizing me at",
        "the moment, but would continue to follow Carton.",
        "I was in great hopes that he was going to get the diamonds, and that by suddenly appearing",
        "and making myself known to him when he least expected it I might startle the truth out of",
        "him.",
        "I followed him down into the Tube station at Hyde Park Corner.",
        "He was standing by himself at the end of the platform.",
        "There was some girl standing near, but no one else.",
        "I decided that I would accost him then and there.",
        "You know what happened.",
        "In the sudden shock of seeing a man whom he imagined far away in South Africa, he lost",
        "his head and stepped back upon the line.",
        "He was always a coward.",
        "Under the pretext of being a doctor, I managed to search his pockets.",
        "There was a wallet with some notes in it and one or two unimportant letters, there was a",
        "roll of films\u2013which I must have dropped somewhere later\u2013and there was a piece of paper with an appointment",
        "made on it for the 22nd on the Kilmorden Castle .",
        "In my haste to get away before anyone detained me, I dropped that also, but fortunately I remembered",
        "the figures. \u2018I hurried to the nearest cloak-room and hastily removed my make-up.",
        "I did not want to be laid by the heels for picking a dead man\u2019s pocket.",
        "Then I retraced my steps to the Hyde Park Hotel.",
        "Nadina was still having lunch.",
        "I needn\u2019t describe in detail how I followed her down to Marlow.",
        "She went into the house, and I spoke to the woman at the lodge, pretending that I was",
        "with her.",
        "Then I, too, went in.",
        "He stopped.",
        "There was a tense silence. \u2018You will believe me, Anne, won\u2019t you?",
        "I swear before God that what I am going to say is true.",
        "I went into the house after her with something very like murder in my heart\u2013and she was dead!",
        "I found her in that first-floor room\u2013God!",
        "It was horrible.",
        "Dead\u2013and I was not more than three minutes behind her.",
        "And there was no sign of anyone else in the house!",
        "Of course I realized at once the terrible position I was in.",
        "By one master-stroke the blackmailed had rid himself of the blackmailer, and at the same time had provided",
        "a victim to whom the crime would be ascribed.",
        "The hand of the \u201cColonel\u201d was very plain.",
        "For the second time I was to be his victim.",
        "Fool that I had been to walk into the trap so easily! \u2018I hardly know what I did",
        "next.",
        "I managed to go out of the place looking fairly normal, but I knew that it could not",
        "be long before the crime was discovered and a description of my appearance telegraphed all over the country.",
        "\u2018I lay low for some days, not daring to make a move.",
        "In the end, chance came to my aid.",
        "I overheard a conversation between two middle-aged gentlemen in the street, one of whom proved to be Sir",
        "Eustace Pedler.",
        "I at once conceived the idea of attaching myself to him as his secretary.",
        "The fragment of conversation I had overheard gave me my clue.",
        "I was now no longer so sure that Sir Eustace Pedler was the \u201cColonel\u201d.",
        "His house might have been appointed as a rendezvous by accident, or for some obscure motive that I",
        "had not fathomed.\u2019 \u2018Do you know,\u2019 I interrupted, \u2018that Guy Pagett was in Marlow at the date of",
        "the murder?\u2019 \u2018That settles it then.",
        "I thought he was at Cannes with Sir Eustace.\u2019 \u2018He was supposed to be in Florence\u2013but he certainly",
        "never went there .",
        "I\u2019m pretty certain he was really in Marlow, but of course I can\u2019t prove it.\u2019 \u2018And to think",
        "I never suspected Pagett for a minute until the night he tried to throw you overboard.",
        "The man\u2019s a marvellous actor.\u2019 \u2018Yes, isn\u2019t he?\u2019 \u2018That explains why the Mill House was chosen.",
        "Pagett could probably get in and out of it unobserved.",
        "Of course he made no objection to my accompanying Sir Eustace across in the boat.",
        "He didn\u2019t want me laid by the heels immediately.",
        "You see, evidently Nadina didn\u2019t bring the jewels with her to the rendezvous, as they had counted on",
        "her doing.",
        "I fancy that Carton really had them and concealed them somewhere on the Kilmorden Castle \u2013that\u2019s where he",
        "came in.",
        "They hoped that I might have some clue as to where they were hidden.",
        "As long as the \u201cColonel\u201d did not recover the diamonds, he was still in danger\u2013hence his anxiety to",
        "get them at all costs.",
        "Where the devil Carton hid them\u2013if he did hide them\u2013I don\u2019t know.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s another story,\u2019 I quoted. \u2018My",
        "story.",
        "And I\u2019m going to tell it to you now.\u2019 Chapter 27 Harry listened attentively whilst I recounted all",
        "the events that I have narrated in these pages.",
        "The thing that bewildered and astonished him most was to find that all along the diamonds had been",
        "in my possession\u2013or rather in Suzanne\u2019s.",
        "That was a fact he had never suspected.",
        "Of course, after hearing his story, I realized the point of Carton\u2019s little arrangement\u2013or rather Nadina\u2019s, since I",
        "had no doubt that it was her brain which had conceived the plan.",
        "No surprise tactics executed against her or her husband could result in the seizure of the diamonds.",
        "The secret was locked in her own brain, and the \u2018Colonel\u2019 was not likely to guess that they",
        "had been entrusted to the keeping of an ocean steward!",
        "Harry\u2019s vindication from the old charge of theft seemed assured.",
        "It was the other graver charge that paralysed all our activities.",
        "For, as things stood, he could not come out in the open to prove his case.",
        "The one thing we came back to, again and again, was the identity of the \u2018Colonel\u2019.",
        "Was he, or was he not, Guy Pagett? \u2018I should say he was but for one thing,\u2019 said",
        "Harry. \u2018It seems pretty much of a certainty that it was Pagett who murdered Anita Gr\u00fcnberg at Marlow\u2013and",
        "that certainly lends colour to the supposition that he is actually the \u201cColonel\u201d, since Anita\u2019s business was not",
        "of the nature to be discussed with a subordinate.",
        "No\u2013the only thing that militates against that theory is the attempt to put you out of the way",
        "the night of your arrival here.",
        "You saw Pagett left behind at Cape Town\u2013by no possible means could he have arrived here before the",
        "following Wednesday.",
        "He is unlikely to have any emissaries in this part of the world, and all his plans were",
        "laid to deal with you in Cape Town.",
        "He might, of course, have cabled instructions to some lieutenant of his in Johannesburg, who could have joined",
        "the Rhodesian train at Mafeking, but his instructions would have had to be particularly definite to allow of",
        "that note being written.\u2019 We sat silent for a moment, then Harry went on slowly: \u2018You say that",
        "Mrs Blair was asleep when you left the hotel and that you heard Sir Eustace dictating to Miss",
        "Pettigrew?",
        "Where was Colonel Race?\u2019 \u2018I could not find him anywhere.\u2019 \u2018Had he any reason to believe that\u2013you and",
        "I might be friendly with each other?\u2019 \u2018He might have had,\u2019 I answered thoughtfully, remembering our conversation on",
        "the way back from the Matopos. \u2018He\u2019s a very powerful personality,\u2019 I continued, \u2018but not at all my",
        "idea of the \u201cColonel\u201d.",
        "And, anyway, such an idea would be absurd.",
        "He\u2019s in the Secret Service.\u2019 \u2018How do we know that he is?",
        "It\u2019s the easiest thing in the world to throw out a hint of that kind.",
        "No one contradicts it, and the rumour spreads until everyone believes it as gospel truth.",
        "It provides an excuse for all sorts of doubtful doings.",
        "Anne, do you like Race?\u2019 \u2018I do\u2013and I don\u2019t.",
        "He repels me and at the same time fascinates me; but I know one thing, I\u2019m always a",
        "little afraid of him.\u2019 \u2018He was in South Africa, you know, at the time of the Kimberley robbery,\u2019",
        "said Harry slowly. \u2018But it was he who told Suzanne all about the \u201cColonel\u201d and how he had",
        "been in Paris trying to get on his track.\u2019 \u2018 Camouflage \u2013of a particularly clever kind.\u2019 \u2018But where",
        "does Pagett come in?",
        "Is he in Race\u2019s pay?\u2019 \u2018Perhaps,\u2019 said Harry slowly, \u2018he doesn\u2019t come in at all.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018Think back,",
        "Anne.",
        "Did you ever hear Pagett\u2019s own account of that night on the Kilmorden? \u2019 \u2018Yes\u2013through Sir Eustace.\u2019 I",
        "repeated it.",
        "Harry listened closely. \u2018He saw a man coming from the direction of Sir Eustace\u2019s cabin and followed him",
        "up on deck.",
        "Is that what he says?",
        "Now, who had the cabin opposite to Sir Eustace?",
        "Colonel Race.",
        "Supposing Colonel Race crept up on deck, and, foiled in his attack on you, fled round the deck",
        "and met Pagett just coming through the saloon door.",
        "He knocks him down and springs inside, closing the door.",
        "We dash round and find Pagett lying there.",
        "How\u2019s that?\u2019 \u2018You forget that he declares positively it was you who knocked him down.\u2019 \u2018Well, suppose that",
        "just as he regains consciousness he sees me disappearing in the distance?",
        "Wouldn\u2019t he take it for granted that I was his assailant?",
        "Especially as he thought all along it was I he was following?\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s possible, yes,\u2019 I said slowly.",
        "\u2018But it alters all our ideas.",
        "And there are other things.\u2019 \u2018Most of them are open to explanation.",
        "The man who followed you in Cape Town spoke to Pagett, and Pagett looked at his watch.",
        "The man might have merely asked him the time.\u2019 \u2018It was just a coincidence, you mean?\u2019 \u2018Not exactly.",
        "There\u2019s a method in all this, connecting Pagett with the affair.",
        "Why was the Mill House chosen for the murder?",
        "Was it because Pagett had been in Kimberley when the diamonds were stolen?",
        "Would he have been made the scapegoat if I had not appeared so providentially upon the scene?\u2019 \u2018Then",
        "you think he may be entirely innocent?\u2019 \u2018It looks like it, but, if so, we\u2019ve got to find",
        "out what he was doing in Marlow.",
        "If he\u2019s got a reasonable explanation of that, we\u2019re on the right tack.\u2019 He got up. \u2018It\u2019s past",
        "midnight.",
        "Turn in, Anne, and get some sleep.",
        "Just before dawn I\u2019ll take you over in the boat.",
        "You must catch the train at Livingstone.",
        "I\u2019ve got a friend there who will keep you hidden away until the train starts.",
        "You go to Bulawayo and catch the Beira train there.",
        "I can find out from my friend in Livingstone what\u2019s going on at the hotel and where your",
        "friends are now.\u2019 \u2018Beira,\u2019 I said meditatively. \u2018Yes, Anne, it\u2019s Beira for you.",
        "This is man\u2019s work.",
        "Leave it to me.\u2019 We had had a momentary respite from emotion whilst we talked the situation out,",
        "but it was on us again now.",
        "We did not even look at each other. \u2018Very well,\u2019 I said, and passed into the hut.",
        "I lay down on the skin-covered couch, but I didn\u2019t sleep, and outside I could hear Harry Rayburn",
        "pacing up and down, up and down through the long dark hours.",
        "At last he called me: \u2018Come, Anne, it\u2019s time to go.\u2019 I got up and came out obediently.",
        "It was still quite dark, but I knew that dawn was not far off. \u2018We\u2019ll take the canoe,",
        "not the motor-boat\u2013\u2019 Harry began, when suddenly he stopped dead and held up his hand. \u2018Hush!",
        "What\u2019s that?\u2019 I listened, but could hear nothing.",
        "His ears were sharper than mine, however, the ears of a man who has lived long in the",
        "wilderness.",
        "Presently I heard it too\u2013the faint splash of paddles in the water coming from the direction of the",
        "right bank of the river and rapidly approaching our little landing-stage.",
        "We strained our eyes in the darkness, and could make out a dark blur on the surface of",
        "the water.",
        "It was a boat.",
        "Then there was a momentary spurt of flame.",
        "Someone had struck a match.",
        "By its light I recognized one figure, the red-bearded Dutchman of the villa at Muizenberg.",
        "The others were natives. \u2018Quick\u2013back to the hut.\u2019 Harry swept me back with him.",
        "He took down a couple of rifles and a revolver from the wall. \u2018Can you load a rifle?\u2019",
        "\u2018I never have.",
        "Show me how.\u2019 I grasped his instructions well enough.",
        "We closed the door and Harry stood by the window which overlooked the landing-stage.",
        "The boat was just about to run alongside it. \u2018Who\u2019s that?\u2019 called out Harry, in a ringing voice.",
        "Any doubt we might have had as to our visitors\u2019 intentions was swiftly resolved.",
        "A hail of bullets splattered round us.",
        "Fortunately neither of us was hit.",
        "Harry raised the rifle.",
        "It spat murderously, and again and again.",
        "I heard two groans and a splash. \u2018That\u2019s given \u2019em something to think about,\u2019 he muttered grimly, as",
        "he reached for the second rifle. \u2018Stand well back, Anne, for God\u2019s sake.",
        "And load quickly.\u2019 More bullets.",
        "One just grazed Harry\u2019s cheek.",
        "His answering fire was more deadly than theirs.",
        "I had the rifle reloaded when he turned for it.",
        "He caught me close with his left arm and kissed me once savagely before he turned to the",
        "window again.",
        "Suddenly he uttered a shout. \u2018They\u2019re going\u2013had enough of it.",
        "They\u2019re a good mark out there on the water, and they can\u2019t see how many of us there",
        "are.",
        "They\u2019re routed for the moment\u2013but they\u2019ll come back.",
        "We\u2019ll have to get ready for them.\u2019 He flung down the rifle and turned to me. \u2018Anne!",
        "You beauty!",
        "You wonder!",
        "You little queen!",
        "As brave as a lion.",
        "Black-haired witch!\u2019 He caught me in his arms.",
        "He kissed my hair, my eyes, my mouth. \u2018And now to business,\u2019 he said, suddenly releasing me. \u2018Get",
        "out those tins of paraffin.\u2019 I did as I was told.",
        "He was busy inside the hut.",
        "Presently I saw him on the roof of the hut, crawling along with something in his arms.",
        "He rejoined me in a minute or two. \u2018Go down to the boat.",
        "We\u2019ll have to carry it across the island to the other side.\u2019 He picked up the paraffin as",
        "I disappeared. \u2018They\u2019re coming back,\u2019 I called softly.",
        "I had seen the blur moving out from the opposite shore.",
        "He ran down to me. \u2018Just in time.",
        "Why\u2013where the hell\u2019s the boat?\u2019 Both had been cut adrift.",
        "Harry whistled softly. \u2018We\u2019re in a tight place, honey.",
        "Mind?\u2019 \u2018Not with you.\u2019 \u2018Ah, but dying together\u2019s not much fun.",
        "We\u2019ll do better than that.",
        "See\u2013they\u2019ve got two boat-loads this time.",
        "Going to land at two different points.",
        "Now for my little scenic effect.\u2019 Almost as he spoke a long flame shot up from the hut.",
        "Its light illuminated two crouching figures huddled together on the roof. \u2018My old clothes\u2013stuffed with rags\u2013but they won\u2019t",
        "tumble to it for some time.",
        "Come, Anne, we\u2019ve got to try desperate means.\u2019 Hand in hand, we raced across the island.",
        "Only a narrow channel of water divided it from the shore on that side. \u2018We\u2019ve got to swim",
        "for it.",
        "Can you swim at all, Anne?",
        "Not that it matters.",
        "I can get you across.",
        "It\u2019s the wrong side for a boat\u2013too many rocks, but the right side for swimming, and the right",
        "side for Livingstone.\u2019 \u2018I can swim a little\u2013further than that.",
        "What\u2019s the danger, Harry?\u2019 For I had seen the grim look on his face. \u2018Sharks?\u2019 \u2018No, you little",
        "goose.",
        "Sharks live in the sea.",
        "But you\u2019re sharp, Anne.",
        "Crocs, that\u2019s the trouble.\u2019 \u2018Crocodiles?\u2019 \u2018Yes, don\u2019t think of them\u2013or say your prayers, whichever you feel inclined.\u2019 We",
        "plunged in.",
        "My prayers must have been efficacious, for we reached the shore without adventure, and drew ourselves up wet",
        "and dripping on the bank. \u2018Now for Livingstone.",
        "It\u2019s rough going, I\u2019m afraid, and wet clothes won\u2019t make it any better.",
        "But it\u2019s got to be done.\u2019 That walk was a nightmare.",
        "My wet skirts flapped round my legs, and my stockings were soon torn off by the thorns.",
        "Finally, I stopped, utterly exhausted.",
        "Harry came back to me. \u2018Hold up, honey.",
        "I\u2019ll carry you for a bit.\u2019 That was the way I came into Livingstone, slung acrossd his shoulder",
        "like a sack of coals.",
        "How he did it for all that way, I don\u2019t know.",
        "The first faint light of dawn was just breaking.",
        "Harry\u2019s friend was a young man of twenty years old who kept a store of native curios.",
        "His name was Ned\u2013perhaps he had another, but I never heard it.",
        "He didn\u2019t seem in the least surprised to see Harry walk in, dripping wet, holding an equally dripping",

        "An able-bodied young woman like Anne Beddingfeld is perfectly well able to take care of herself,\u2019 I frowned",

        "The idea of suicide seems impossible.",

        "There are signs on the path near the bridge which seem to show that the girl walked deliberately",
        "off the edge.",
        "If so, of course, she must have been dashed to pieces on the rocks below.",
        "Unfortunately, most of the footprints were obliterated by a party of tourists who chose to walk that way",

        "How long the girl has been there is not definitely known, but it seems pretty clear that she",

        "worse.",
        "I dare say I shall be shot by a striker, anyway.",
        "Mrs Blair was to have accompanied me, but at the last minute she changed her mind and decided",
        "to stay on at the Falls.",
        "It seems as though she couldn\u2019t bear to take her eyes off Race.",
        "She came to me tonight, and said, with some hesitation, that she had a favour to ask.",
        "Would I take charge of her souvenirs for her? \u2018Not the animals?\u2019 I asked, in lively alarm.",
        "I always felt that I should get stuck with those beastly animals sooner or later.",
        "In the end, we effected a compromise.",
        "I took charge of two small wooden boxes for her which contained fragile articles.",
        "The animals are to be packed by the local store in vast crates and sent to Cape Town",
        "by rail, where Pagett will see to their being stored.",
        "The people who are packing them say that they are of a particularly awkward shape !",
        ", and that special cases will have to be made.",
        "I pointed out to Mrs Blair that by the time she has got them home those animals will",
        "have cost her easily a pound apiece!",
        "Pagett is straining at the leash to rejoin me in Jo\u2019burg.",
        "I shall make an excuse of Mrs Blair\u2019s cases to keep him in Cape Town.",
        "I have written him that he must receive the cases and see to their safe disposal, as they",

        "or be removed by him, to Pretoria. \u2018You expect trouble, then?\u2019 I asked.",

        "to know.\u2019 \u2018She was on the island all the time.\u2019 \u2018Which island?",
        "Not the one with the young man on it?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018How very improper,\u2019 I said. \u2018Pagett will be",
        "quite shocked.",
        "He always did disapprove of Anne Beddingfeld.",
        "I suppose that was the young man she originally intended to meet in Durban?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t think so.\u2019",
        "\u2018Don\u2019t tell me anything if you don\u2019t want to,\u2019 I said, by way of encouraging him. \u2018I fancy",
        "that this is a young man we should all be very glad to lay our hands on.\u2019 \u2018Not\u2013?\u2019",
        "I cried, in rising excitement.",
        "He nodded. \u2018Harry Rayburn, alias Harry Lucas\u2013that\u2019s his real name, you know.",
        "He\u2019s given us all the slip once more, but we\u2019re bound to rope him in soon.\u2019 \u2018Dear me,",
        "dear me,\u2019 I murmured. \u2018We don\u2019t suspect the girl of complicity in any case.",
        "On her side it\u2019s\u2013just a love-affair.\u2019 I always did think Race was in love with Anne.",
        "The way he said those last words made me feel sure of it. \u2018She\u2019s gone to Beira,\u2019 he",
        "continued rather hastily. \u2018Indeed,\u2019 I said, staring. \u2018How do you know?\u2019 \u2018She wrote to me from Bulawayo, telling",
        "me she was going home that way.",
        "The best thing she can do, poor child.\u2019 \u2018Somehow, I don\u2019t fancy she is in Beira,\u2019 I said",
        "meditatively. \u2018She was just starting when she wrote.\u2019 I was puzzled.",
        "Somebody was clearly lying.",
        "Without stopping to reflect that Anne might have excellent reasons for her misleading statements, I gave myself up",
        "to the pleasure of scoring off Race.",
        "He is always so cocksure.",
        "I took the telegram from my pocket and handed it to him. \u2018Then how do you explain this?\u2019",
        "I asked nonchalantly.",
        "He seemed dumbfounded. \u2018She said she was just starting for Beira,\u2019 he said, in a dazed voice.",
        "I know that Race is supposed to be clever.",
        "He is, in my opinion, rather a stupid man.",
        "It never seemed to occur to him that girls do not always tell the truth. \u2018Kimberley too.",
        "What are they doing there?\u2019 he muttered. \u2018Yes, that surprised me.",
        "I should have thought Miss Anne would have been in the thick of it here, gathering copy for",
        "the Daily Budget.\u2019 \u2018Kimberley,\u2019 he said again.",
        "The place seemed to upset him. \u2018There\u2019s nothing to see there\u2013the pits aren\u2019t being worked.\u2019 \u2018You know what",
        "women are,\u2019 I said vaguely.",
        "He shook his head and went off.",
        "I have evidently given him something to think about.",
        "No sooner had he departed than my Government official reappeared. \u2018I hope you will forgive me for troubling",
        "you again, Sir Eustace,\u2019 he apologized. \u2018But there are one or two questions I should like to ask",
        "you.\u2019 \u2018Certainly, my dear fellow,\u2019 I said cheerfully. \u2018Ask away.\u2019 \u2018It concerns your secretary\u2013\u2019 \u2018I know nothing about",
        "him,\u2019 I said hastily. \u2018He foisted himself upon me in London, robbed me of valuable papers\u2013for which I",
        "shall be hauled over the coals\u2013and disappeared like a conjuring trick at Cape Town.",
        "It\u2019s true that I was at the Falls at the same time as he was, but I was",
        "at the hotel, and he was on an island.",
        "I can assure you that I never set eyes upon him the whole time that I was there.\u2019",
        "I paused for breath. \u2018You misunderstand me.",
        "It was of your other secretary that I spoke.\u2019 \u2018What?",
        "Pagett?\u2019 I cried, in lively astonishment. \u2018He\u2019s been with me eight years\u2013a most trustworthy fellow.\u2019 My interlocutor smiled.",
        "\u2018We are still at cross-purposes.",
        "I refer to the lady.\u2019 \u2018Miss Pettigrew?\u2019 I exclaimed. \u2018Yes.",
        "She has been seen coming out of Agrasato\u2019s Native Curio-shop.\u2019 \u2018God bless my soul!\u2019 I interrupted. \u2018I was",
        "going into that place myself this afternoon.",
        "You might have caught me coming out!\u2019 There doesn\u2019t seem to be any innocent thing that one can",
        "do in Jo\u2019burg without being suspected for it. \u2018Ah! but she has been seen there more than once\u2013and",
        "in rather doubtful circumstances.",
        "I may as well tell you\u2013in confidence, Sir Eustace\u2013that the place is suspected of being a well-known rendezvous",
        "used by the secret organization behind this revolution.",
        "That is why I should be glad to hear all that you can tell me about this lady.",
        "Where and how did you come to engage her?\u2019 \u2018She was lent to me,\u2019 I replied coldly, \u2018by",

        "She joined me there with the utmost dispatch, heralding her arrival with telegrams sent off en route .",
        "I was awfully surprised to find that she really was fond of me\u2013I thought I had been just",
        "a new sensation, but she positively fell on my neck and wept when we met.",
        "When we had recovered from our emotion a little, I sat down on the bed and told her",
        "the whole story from A to Z. \u2018You always did suspect Colonel Race,\u2019 she said thoughtfully, when I",
        "had finished. \u2018I didn\u2019t until the night you disappeared.",
        "I liked him so much all along and thought he would make such a nice husband for you.",
        "Oh, Anne, dear, don\u2019t be cross, but how do you know that this young man of yours is",
        "telling the truth?",
        "You believe every word he says.\u2019 \u2018Of course I do,\u2019 I cried indignantly. \u2018But what is there in",
        "him that attracts you so?",
        "I don\u2019t see that there\u2019s anything in him at all except his rather reckless good looks and his",
        "modern Sheik-cum-Stone-Age love-making.\u2019 I poured out the vials of my wrath upon Suzanne for some minutes. \u2018Just because",
        "you\u2019re comfortably married and getting fat, you\u2019ve forgotten that there\u2019s any such thing as romance,\u2019 I ended. \u2018Oh,",
        "I\u2019m not getting fat, Anne.",
        "All the worry I\u2019ve had about you lately must have worn me to a shred.\u2019 \u2018You look particularly",
        "well nourished,\u2019 I said coldly. \u2018I should say you must have put on about half a stone.\u2019 \u2018And",
        "I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m so comfortably married either,\u2019 continued Suzanne in a melancholy voice. \u2018I\u2019ve been having",
        "the most dreadful cables from Clarence ordering me to come home at once.",
        "At last I didn\u2019t answer them, and now I haven\u2019t heard for over a fortnight.\u2019 I\u2019m afraid I",

        "but didn\u2019t know what to do about the diamonds.",
        "I was afraid to keep them in my possession\u2013\u2019 Suzanne looked round her uneasily, as though she feared",
        "the walls might have ears, and then whispered vehemently in my ear. \u2018A distinctly good idea,\u2019 I approved.",
        "\u2018At the time, that is.",
        "It\u2019s a bit awkward now.",
        "What did Sir Eustace do with the cases?\u2019 \u2018The big ones were sent down to Cape Town.",

        "doing nothing, do you, Anne?\u2019 \u2018Not very much,\u2019 I replied honestly.",

        "I found that it would arrive at 5.40 on the following afternoon and depart again at 6.",
        "I wanted to see Pagett as soon as possible, and that seemed to me a good opportunity.",
        "The situation on the Rand was getting very serious, and it might be a long time before I",
        "got another chance.",
        "The only thing that livened up the day was a wire dispatched from Johannesburg.",

        "Suzanne employed herself in sending off a long soothing cable to the far-off Clarence.",
        "She became quite sentimental over him.",
        "In her way\u2013which of course is quite different from me and Harry\u2013she is really fond of Clarence. \u2018I",

        "some face-cream,\u2019 I said soothingly.",
        "Suzanne rubbed a little on the tip of her charming nose. \u2018I shall want some more face-cream soon",
        "too,\u2019 she remarked, \u2018and you can only get this kind in Paris.\u2019 She sighed. \u2018Paris!\u2019 \u2018Suzanne,\u2019 I said,",
        "\u2018very soon you\u2019ll have had enough of South Africa and adventure.\u2019 \u2018I should like a really nice hat,\u2019",

        "He\u2019d be shyer speaking before two of us.\u2019 So it came about that I was standing in the",
        "doorway of the hotel on the following afternoon, struggling with a recalcitrant parasol that refused to go up,",
        "whilst Suzanne lay peacefully on her bed with a book and a basket of fruit.",
        "According to the hotel porter, the train was on its good behaviour today and would be almost on",
        "time, though he was extremely doubtful whether it would ever get through to Johannesburg.",
        "The line had been blown up, so he solemnly assured me.",
        "It sounded cheerful!",
        "The train drew in just ten minutes late.",

        "neighbourhood, yes.\u2019 \u2018Won\u2019t you tell me what those reasons were?\u2019 \u2018Sir Eustace has not already told you?\u2019 \u2018Sir",

        "Does he know?\u2019 \u2018I am almost sure that he does.",

        "I fear it is only too certain.",
        "In any case, I meant to make a clean breast of the matter and offer my resignation.",
        "He is a peculiar man, Miss Beddingfeld, with an abnormal sense of humour.",
        "It seems to amuse him to keep me on tenterhooks.",
        "All the time, I dare say, he was perfectly well aware of the true facts.",
        "Possibly he has known them for years.\u2019 I hoped that sooner or later I should be able to",
        "understand what Pagett was talking about.",
        "He went on fluently: \u2018It is difficult for a man of Sir Eustace\u2019s standing to put himself in",
        "my position.",
        "I know that I was in the wrong, but it seemed a harmless deception.",
        "I would have thought it better taste on his part to have tackled me outright\u2013instead of indulging in",
        "covert jokes at my expense.\u2019 A whistle blew, and the people began to surge back into the train.",
        "\u2018Yes, Mr Pagett,\u2019 I broke in, \u2018I\u2019m sure I quite agree with all you\u2019re saying about Sir Eustace.",
        "But why did you go to Marlow? \u2019 \u2018It was wrong of me, but natural under the circumstances\u2013yes,",
        "I still feel natural under the circumstances.\u2019 \u2018What circumstances?\u2019 I cried desperately.",
        "For the first time, Pagett seemed to recognize that I was asking him a question.",
        "His mind detached itself from the peculiarities of Sir Eustace, and his own justification, and came to rest",
        "on me. \u2018I beg your pardon, Miss Beddingfeld,\u2019 he said stiffly, \u2018but I fail to see your concern",
        "in the matter.\u2019 He was back in the train now, leaning down to speak to me.",
        "I felt desperate.",
        "What could one do with a man like that? \u2018Of course, if it\u2019s so dreadful that you\u2019d be",
        "ashamed to speak of it to me\u2013\u2019 I began spitefully.",
        "At last I had found the right stop.",

        "Ashamed?",
        "I don\u2019t understand you.\u2019 \u2018Then tell me.\u2019 In three short sentences he told me.",

        "It was not in the least what I expected.",
        "I walked slowly back to the hotel.",

        "to the other extreme, wished he had his rifle here, and began bucking about some bridge he guarded",

        "that you can go out and look around you.",
        "Jo\u2019burg will probably be a heap of smoking ruins by tomorrow, so it may be your last chance.\u2019",

        "something I want to say to you when you have the leisure, Sir Eustace.\u2019 \u2018I haven\u2019t got it",
        "now,\u2019 I said hastily. \u2018At this minute I have absolutely no leisure whatsoever.\u2019 Pagett retired. \u2018By the way,\u2019",
        "I called after him, \u2018what was there in those cases of Mrs Blair\u2019s?\u2019 \u2018Some fur rugs, and a",
        "couple of fur\u2013hats, I think.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s right,\u2019 I assented. \u2018She bought them on the train.",
        "They are hats\u2013of a kind\u2013though I hardly wonder at your not recognizing them.",

        "assured him. \u2018Mrs Blair is the kind of woman who never buys less than a dozen or so",
        "of anything.\u2019 \u2018I think that\u2019s all, Sir Eustace, except some miscellaneous odds and ends, a motor-veil and some",
        "odd gloves\u2013that sort of thing.\u2019 \u2018If you hadn\u2019t been a born idiot, Pagett, you would have seen from",
        "the start that those couldn\u2019t possibly be my belongings.\u2019 \u2018I thought some of them might belong to Miss",
        "Pettigrew.\u2019 \u2018Ah, that reminds me\u2013what do you mean by picking me out such a doubtful character as a",
        "secretary?\u2019 And I told him about the searching cross-examination I had been put through.",

        "It was a long time before I could make head or tail of this one.",
        "I did not see him again until lunch-time.",
        "Then he came in brimming over with excitement, like a bloodhound on the scent.",
        "I never have cared for bloodhounds.",
        "The upshot of it all was that he had seen Rayburn. \u2018What?\u2019 I cried, startled.",

        "And that\u2019s not all.",
        "I\u2019ve been making inquiries about her\u2013\u2019 \u2018Wait a bit.",
        "What happened to Rayburn?\u2019 \u2018He and Miss Pettigrew went into that corner curioshop\u2013\u2019 I uttered an involuntary exclamation.",
        "Pagett stopped inquiringly. \u2018Nothing,\u2019 I said. \u2018Go on.\u2019 \u2018I waited outside for ages\u2013but they didn\u2019t come out.",
        "At last I went in.",
        "Sir Eustace, there was no one in the shop!",
        "There must be another way out.\u2019 I stared at him. \u2018As I was saying, I came back to",
        "the hotel and made some inquiries about Miss Pettigrew.\u2019 Pagett lowered his voice and breathed hard as he",
        "always does when he wants to be confidential. \u2018Sir Eustace, a man was seen coming out of her",
        "room last night.\u2019 I raised my eyebrows. \u2018And I always regarded her as a lady of such eminent",
        "respectability,\u2019 I murmured.",
        "Pagett went on without heeding. \u2018I went straight up and searched her room.",
        "What do you think I found?\u2019 I shook my head. \u2018This!\u2019 Pagett held up a safety razor and",
        "a stick of shaving soap. \u2018What should a woman want with these?\u2019 I don\u2019t suppose Pagett ever reads",
        "the advertisements in the high-class ladies\u2019 papers.",
        "I do.",
        "Whilst not proposing to argue with him on the subject, I refused to accept the presence of the",
        "razor as proof positive of Miss Pettigrew\u2019s sex.",
        "Pagett is so hopelessly behind the times.",
        "I should not have been at all surprised if he had produced a cigarette-case to support his theory.",
        "However, even Pagett has his limits. \u2018You\u2019re not convinced, Sir Eustace.",
        "What do you say to this?\u2019 I inspected the article which he dangled aloft triumphantly. \u2018It looks like",
        "hair,\u2019 I remarked distastefully. \u2018It is hair.",
        "I think it\u2019s what they call a toupee.\u2019 \u2018Indeed,\u2019 I commented. \u2018Now are you convinced that that Pettigrew",
        "woman is a man in disguise?\u2019 \u2018Really, my dear Pagett, I think I am.",
        "I might have known it by her feet.\u2019 \u2018Then that\u2019s that.",
        "And now, Sir Eustace, I want to speak to you about my private affairs.",
        "I cannot doubt, from your hints and your continual allusions to the time I was in Florence, that",
        "you have found me out.\u2019 At last the mystery of what Pagett did in Florence is going to",
        "be revealed! \u2018Make a clean breast of it, my dear fellow,\u2019 I said kindly. \u2018Much the best way.\u2019",
        "\u2018Thank you, Sir Eustace.\u2019 \u2018Is it her husband?",
        "Annoying fellows, husbands.",
        "Always turning up when they\u2019re least expected.\u2019 \u2018I fail to follow you, Sir Eustace.",
        "Whose husband?\u2019 \u2018The lady\u2019s husband.\u2019 \u2018What lady?\u2019 \u2018God bless my soul, Pagett, the lady you met in Florence.",
        "There must have been a lady.",
        "Don\u2019t tell me that you merely robbed a church or stabbed an Italian in the back because you",
        "didn\u2019t like his face.\u2019 \u2018I am quite at a loss to understand you, Sir Eustace.",
        "I suppose you are joking.\u2019 \u2018I am an amusing fellow sometimes, when I take the trouble, but I",
        "can assure you that I am not trying to be funny this minute.\u2019 \u2018I hoped that as I",
        "was a good way off you had not recognized me, Sir Eustace.\u2019 \u2018Recognized you where?\u2019 \u2018At Marlow, Sir",
        "Eustace?\u2019 \u2018At Marlow?",
        "What the devil were you doing at Marlow?\u2019 \u2018I thought you understood that\u2013\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m beginning to understand less",
        "and less.",
        "Go back to the beginning of the story and start again.",
        "You went to Florence\u2013\u2019 \u2018Then you don\u2019t know after all\u2013and you didn\u2019t recognize me!\u2019 \u2018As far as I",
        "can judge, you seem to have given yourself away needlessly\u2013made a coward of by your conscience.",
        "But I shall be able to tell better when I\u2019ve heard the whole story.",
        "Now, then, take a deep breath and start again.",
        "You went to Florence\u2013\u2019 \u2018But I didn\u2019t go to Florence.",
        "That is just it.\u2019 \u2018Well, where did you go, then?\u2019 \u2018I went home\u2013to Marlow.\u2019 \u2018What the devil did",
        "you want to go to Marlow for?\u2019 \u2018I wanted to see my wife.",
        "She was in delicate health and expecting\u2013\u2019 \u2018Your wife?",
        "But I didn\u2019t know you were married!\u2019 \u2018No, Sir Eustace, that is just what I am telling you.",
        "I deceived you in this matter.\u2019 \u2018How long have you been married?\u2019 \u2018Just over eight years.",
        "I had been married just six months when I became your secretary.",
        "I did not want to lose the post.",
        "A resident secretary is not supposed to have a wife, so I suppressed the fact.\u2019 \u2018You take my",
        "breath away,\u2019 I remarked. \u2018Where has she been all these years?\u2019 \u2018We have had a small bungalow on",
        "the river at Marlow, quite close to the Mill House, for over five years.\u2019 \u2018God bless my soul,\u2019",
        "I muttered. \u2018Any children?\u2019 \u2018Four children, Sir Eustace.\u2019 I gazed at him in a kind of stupor.",
        "I might have known, all along, that a man like Pagett couldn\u2019t have a guilty secret.",
        "The respectability of Pagett has always been my bane.",
        "That\u2019s just the kind of secret he would have\u2013a wife and four children. \u2018Have you told this to",
        "anyone else?\u2019 I demanded at last, when I had gazed at him in fascinated interest for quite a",
        "long while. \u2018Only Miss Beddingfeld.",
        "She came to the station at Kimberley.\u2019 I continued to stare at him.",
        "He fidgeted under my glance. \u2018I hope, Sir Eustace, that you are not seriously annoyed?\u2019 \u2018My dear fellow,\u2019",
        "I said, \u2018I don\u2019t mind telling you here and now that you\u2019ve blinking well torn it!\u2019 I went",
        "out seriously ruffled.",
        "As I passed the corner curioshop, I was assailed by a sudden irresistible temptation and went in.",
        "The proprietor came forward obsequiously, rubbing his hands. \u2018Can I show you something?",
        "Furs, curios?\u2019 \u2018I want something quite out of the ordinary,\u2019 I said. \u2018It\u2019s for a special occasion.",
        "Will you show me what you\u2019ve got?\u2019 \u2018Perhaps you will come into my back room?",
        "We have many specialities there.\u2019 That is where I made a mistake.",
        "And I thought I was going to be so clever.",
        "I followed him through the swinging porti\u00e8res.",
        "Chapter 32",
        "Anne\u2019s Narrative Resumed",
        "I had great trouble with Suzanne.",
        "She argued, she pleaded, she even wept before she would let me carry out my plan.",
        "But in the end I got my own way.",
        "She promised to carry out my instructions to the letter and came down to the station to bid",
        "me a tearful farewell.",
        "I arrived at my destination the following morning early.",
        "I was met by a short black-bearded Dutchman whom I had never seen before.",
        "He had a car waiting and we drove off.",
        "There was a queer booming in the distance, and I asked him what it was. \u2018Guns,\u2019 he answered",
        "laconically.",
        "So there was fighting going on in Jo\u2019burg!",
        "I gathered that our objective was a spot somewhere in the suburbs of the city.",
        "We turned and twisted and made several detours to get there, and every minute the guns were nearer.",
        "It was an exciting time.",
        "At last we stopped before a somewhat ramshackle building.",
        "The door was opened by a Kafir boy.",
        "My guide signed to me to enter.",
        "I stood irresolute in the dingy square hall.",
        "The man passed me and threw open a door. \u2018The young lady to see Mr Harry Rayburn,\u2019 he",
        "said, and laughed.",
        "Thus announced, I passed in.",
        "The room was sparsely furnished and smelt of cheap tobacco smoke.",
        "Behind a desk a man sat writing.",
        "He looked up and raised his eyebrows. \u2018Dear me,\u2019 he said, \u2018if it isn\u2019t Miss Beddingfeld!\u2019 \u2018I must",
        "be seeing double,\u2019 I apologized. \u2018Is it Mr Chichester, or is it Miss Pettigrew?",
        "There is an extraordinary resemblance to both of them.\u2019 \u2018Both characters are in abeyance for the moment.",
        "I have doffed my petticoats\u2013and my cloth likewise.",
        "Won\u2019t you sit down?\u2019 I accepted a seat composedly. \u2018It would seem,\u2019 I remarked, \u2018that I have come",
        "to the wrong address.\u2019 \u2018From your point of view, I am afraid you have.",
        "Really, Miss Beddingfeld, to fall into the trap a second time!\u2019 \u2018It was not very bright of me,\u2019",
        "I admitted meekly.",
        "Something about my manner seemed to puzzle him. \u2018You hardly seem upset by the occurrence,\u2019 he remarked dryly.",
        "\u2018Would my going into heroics have any effect upon you?\u2019 I asked. \u2018It certainly would not.\u2019 \u2018My Great-aunt",
        "Jane always used to say that a true lady was neither shocked nor surprised at anything that might",
        "happen,\u2019 I murmured dreamily. \u2018I endeavour to live up to her precepts.\u2019 I read Mr Chichester-Pettigrew\u2019s opinion so",
        "plainly written on his face that I hastened into speech once more. \u2018You really are positively marvellous at",
        "make-up,\u2019 I said generously. \u2018All the time you were Miss Pettigrew I never recognized you\u2013even when you broke",
        "your pencil in the shock of seeing me climb upon the train at Cape Town.\u2019 He tapped upon",
        "the desk with the pencil he was holding in his hand at the minute. \u2018All this is very",
        "well in its way, but we must get to business.",
        "Perhaps, Miss Beddingfeld, you can guess why we required your presence here?\u2019 \u2018You will excuse me,\u2019 I said,",
        "\u2018but I never do business with anyone but principals.\u2019 I had read the phrase or something like it",
        "in a moneylender\u2019s circular, and I was rather pleased with it.",
        "It certainly had a devastating effect upon Mr Chichester-Pettigrew.",
        "He opened his mouth and then shut it again.",
        "I beamed upon him. \u2018My Great-uncle George\u2019s maxim,\u2019 I added, as an afterthought. \u2018Great-aunt Jane\u2019s husband, you know.",
        "He made knobs for brass beds.\u2019 I doubt if Chichester-Pettigrew had ever been ragged before.",
        "He didn\u2019t like it at all. \u2018I think you would be wise to alter your tone, young lady.\u2019",
        "I did not reply, but yawned\u2013a delicate little yawn that hinted at intense boredom. \u2018What the devil\u2013\u2019 he",
        "began forcibly.",
        "I interrupted him. \u2018I can assure you it\u2019s no good shouting at me.",
        "We are only wasting time here.",
        "I have no intention of talking with underlings.",
        "You will save a lot of time and annoyance by taking me straight to Sir Eustace Pedler.\u2019 \u2018To\u2013\u2019",
        "He looked dumbfounded. \u2018Yes,\u2019 I said. \u2018Sir Eustace Pedler.\u2019 \u2018I\u2013I\u2013excuse me\u2013\u2019 He bolted from the room like a",
        "rabbit.",
        "I took advantage of the respite to open my bag and powder my nose thoroughly.",
        "Also I settled my hat at a more becoming angle.",
        "Then I settled myself to wait with patience for my enemy\u2019s return.",
        "He reappeared in a subtly chastened mood. \u2018Will you come this way, Miss Beddingfeld?\u2019 I followed him up",
        "the stairs.",
        "He knocked at the door of a room, a brisk \u2018Come in\u2019 sounded from inside, and he opened",
        "the door and motioned to me to pass inside.",
        "Sir Eustace Pedler sprang up to greet me, genial and smiling. \u2018Well, well, Miss Anne.\u2019 He shook me",
        "warmly by the hand. \u2018I\u2019m delighted to see you.",
        "Come and sit down.",
        "Not tired after your journey?",
        "That\u2019s good.\u2019 He sat down facing me, still beaming.",
        "It left me rather at a loss.",
        "His manner was so completely natural. \u2018Quite right to insist on being brought straight to me,\u2019 he went",
        "on. \u2018Minks is a fool.",
        "A clever actor\u2013but a fool.",
        "That was Minks you saw downstairs.\u2019 \u2018Oh, really,\u2019 I said feebly. \u2018And now,\u2019 said Sir Eustace cheerfully, \u2018let\u2019s",
        "get down to facts.",
        "How long have you known that I was the \u201cColonel\u201d?\u2019 \u2018Ever since Mr Pagett told me that he",
        "had seen you in Marlow when you were supposed to be in Cannes.\u2019 Sir Eustace nodded ruefully. \u2018Yes,",
        "I told the fool he\u2019d blinking well torn it.",
        "He didn\u2019t understand, of course.",
        "His whole mind was set on whether I\u2019d recognized him .",
        "It never occurred to him to wonder what I was doing down there.",
        "A piece of sheer bad luck that was.",
        "I arranged it all so carefully too, sending him off to Florence, telling the hotel I was going",
        "over to Nice for one night or possibly two.",
        "Then, by the time the murder was discovered, I was back again in Cannes, with nobody dreaming that",
        "I\u2019d ever left the Riviera.\u2019 He still spoke quite naturally and unaffectedly.",
        "I had to pinch myself to understand that this was all real\u2013that the man in front of me",
        "was really that deep-dyed criminal, the \u2018Colonel\u2019.",
        "I followed things out in my mind. \u2018Then it was you who tried to throw me overboard on",
        "the Kilmorden ,\u2019 I said slowly. \u2018It was you that Pagett followed up on deck that night?\u2019 He",
        "shrugged his shoulders. \u2018I apologize, my dear child, I really do.",
        "I always liked you\u2013but you were so confoundedly interfering.",
        "I couldn\u2019t have all my plans brought to naught by a chit of a girl.\u2019 \u2018I think your",
        "plan at the Falls was really the cleverest,\u2019 I said, endeavouring to look at the thing in a",
        "detached fashion. \u2018I would have been ready to swear anywhere that you were in the hotel when I",
        "went out.",
        "Seeing is believing in future.\u2019 \u2018Yes, Minks had one of his greatest successes, as Miss Pettigrew, and he",
        "can imitate my voice quite creditably.\u2019 \u2018There is one thing I should like to know.\u2019 \u2018Yes?\u2019 \u2018How did",
        "you induce Pagett to engage her?\u2019 \u2018Oh, that was quite simple.",
        "She met Pagett in the doorway of the Trade Commissioner\u2019s office or the Chamber of Mines, or wherever",
        "it was he went\u2013told him I had \u2019phoned down in a hurry, and that she had been selected",
        "by the Government department in question.",
        "Pagett swallowed it like a lamb.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019re very frank,\u2019 I said, studying him. \u2018There\u2019s no earthly reason why",
        "I shouldn\u2019t be.\u2019 I didn\u2019t like the sound of that.",
        "I hastened to put my own interpretation on it. \u2018You believe in the success of this Revolution?",
        "You\u2019ve burnt your boats.\u2019 \u2018For an otherwise intelligent young woman, that\u2019s a singularly unintelligent remark.",
        "No, my dear child, I do not believe in this Revolution.",
        "I give it a couple of days longer and it will fizzle out ignominiously.\u2019 \u2018Not one of your",
        "successes, in fact?\u2019 I said nastily. \u2018Like all women, you\u2019ve no idea of business.",
        "The job I took on was to supply certain explosives and arms\u2013heavily paid for\u2013to foment feeling generally, and",
        "to incriminate certain people up to the hilt.",
        "I\u2019ve carried out my contract with complete success, and I was careful to be paid in advance.",
        "I took special care over the whole thing, as I intended it be my last contract before retiring",
        "from business.",
        "As for burning my boats, as you call it, I simply don\u2019t know what you mean.",
        "I\u2019m not the rebel chief, or anything of that kind\u2013I\u2019m a distinguished English visitor, who had the misfortune",
        "to go nosing into a certain curioshop\u2013and saw a little more than he was meant to, and so",
        "the poor fellow was kidnapped.",
        "Tomorrow, or the day after, when circumstances permit, I shall be found tied up somewhere, in a pitiable",
        "state of terror and starvation.\u2019 \u2018Ah!\u2019 I said slowly. \u2018But what about me?\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s just it,\u2019 said Sir",
        "Eustace softly. \u2018What about you?",
        "I\u2019ve got you here\u2013I don\u2019t want to rub it in in any way\u2013but I\u2019ve got you here very",
        "neatly.",
        "The question is, what am I going to do with you?",
        "The simplest way of disposing of you\u2013and, I may add, the pleasantest to myself\u2013is the way of marriage.",
        "Wives can\u2019t accuse their husbands, you know, and I\u2019d rather like a pretty young wife to hold my",
        "hand and glance at me out of liquid eyes\u2013don\u2019t flash them at me so!",
        "You quite frighten me.",
        "I see that the plan does not commend itself to you?\u2019 \u2018It does not.\u2019 Sir Eustace sighed. \u2018A",
        "pity!",
        "But I am no Adelphi villain.",
        "The usual trouble, I suppose.",
        "You love another, as the books say.\u2019 \u2018I love another.\u2019 \u2018I thought as much\u2013first I thought it was",
        "that long-legged, pompous ass, Race, but I suppose it\u2019s the young hero who fished you out of the",
        "Falls that night.",
        "Women have no taste.",
        "Neither of those two have half the brains that I have.",
        "I\u2019m such an easy person to underestimate.\u2019 I think he was right about that.",
        "Although I knew well enough the kind of man he was and must be, I could not bring",
        "myself to realize it.",
        "He had tried to kill me on more than one occasion, he had actually killed another woman, and",
        "he was responsible for endless other deeds of which I knew nothing, and yet I was quite unable",
        "to bring myself into the frame of mind for appreciating his deeds as they deserved.",
        "I could not think of him as other than our amusing, genial travelling companion.",
        "I could not even feel frightened of him\u2013and yet I knew he was capable of having me murdered",
        "in cold blood if it struck him as necessary.",
        "The only parallel I can think of is the case of Stevenson\u2019s Long John Silver.",
        "He must have been much the same kind of man. \u2018Well, well,\u2019 said this extraordinary person, leaning back",
        "in his chair. \u2018It\u2019s a pity that the idea of being Lady Pedler doesn\u2019t appeal to you.",
        "The other alternatives are rather crude.\u2019 I felt a nasty feeling going up and down my spine.",
        "Of course I had known all along that I was taking a big risk, but the prize had",
        "seemed worth it.",
        "Would things turn out as I had calculated, or would they not? \u2018The fact of the matter is,\u2019",
        "Sir Eustace was continuing, \u2018I\u2019ve a weakness for you.",
        "I really don\u2019t want to proceed to extremes.",
        "Suppose you tell me the whole story, from the very beginning, and let\u2019s see what we can make",
        "of it.",
        "But no romancing, mind\u2013I want the truth.\u2019 I was not going to make any mistake over that.",
        "I had a great deal of respect for Sir Eustace\u2019s shrewdness.",
        "It was a moment for the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.",
        "I told him the whole story, omitting nothing, up to the moment of my rescue by Harry.",
        "When I had finished, he nodded his head in approval. \u2018Wise girl.",
        "You\u2019ve made a clean breast of the thing.",
        "And let me tell you I should soon have caught you out if you hadn\u2019t.",
        "A lot of people wouldn\u2019t believe your story, anyway, expecially the beginning part, but I do.",
        "You\u2019re the kind of girl who would start off like that\u2013at a moment\u2019s notice, on the slenderest of",
        "motives.",
        "You\u2019ve had amazing luck, of course, but sooner or later the amateur runs up against the professional and",
        "then the result is a foregone conclusion.",
        "I am the professional.",
        "I started on this business when I was quite a youngster.",
        "All things considered, it seemed to me a good way of getting rich quickly.",
        "I always could think things out and devise ingenious schemes\u2013and I never made the mistake of trying to",
        "carry out my schemes myself.",
        "Always employ the expert\u2013that has been my motto.",
        "The one time I departed from it I came to grief\u2013but I couldn\u2019t trust anyone to do that",
        "job for me.",
        "Nadina knew too much.",
        "I\u2019m an easy-going man, kind-hearted and good-tempered so long as I\u2019m not thwarted.",
        "Nadina both thwarted me and threatened me\u2013just as I was at the apex of a successful career.",
        "Once she was dead and the diamonds were in my possession, I was safe.",
        "I\u2019ve come to the conclusion now that I bungled the job.",
        "That idiot Pagett, with his wife and family!",
        "My fault\u2013it tickled my sense of humour to employ the fellow, with his Cinquecento poisoner\u2019s face and his",
        "mid-Victorian soul.",
        "A maxim for you, my dear Anne.",
        "Don\u2019t let your sense of humour carry you away.",
        "For years I\u2019ve had an instinct that it would be wise to get rid of Pagett, but the",
        "fellow was so hard-working and conscientious that I honestly couldn\u2019t find an excuse for sacking him.",
        "So I let things drift. \u2018But we\u2019re wandering from the point.",
        "The question is what to do with you.",
        "Your narrative was admirably clear, but there is one thing that still escapes me.",
        "Where are the diamonds now?\u2019 \u2018Harry Rayburn has them,\u2019 I said, watching him.",
        "His face did not change, it retained its expression of sardonic good-humour. \u2018H\u2019m.",
        "I want those diamonds.\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t see much chance of your getting them,\u2019 I replied. \u2018Don\u2019t you?",
        "Now I do.",
        "I don\u2019t want to be unpleasant, but I should like you to reflect that a dead girl or",
        "so found in this quarter of the city will occasion no surprise.",
        "There\u2019s a man downstairs who does those sort of jobs very neatly.",
        "Now, you\u2019re a sensible young woman.",
        "What I propose is this: you will sit down and write to Harry Rayburn, telling him to join",
        "you here and bring the diamonds with him\u2013\u2019 \u2018I won\u2019t do anything of the kind.\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t interrupt your",
        "elders.",
        "I propose to make a bargain with you.",
        "The diamonds in exchange for your life.",
        "And don\u2019t make any mistake about it, your life is absolutely in my power.\u2019 \u2018And Harry?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m far",
        "too tender-hearted to part two young lovers.",
        "He shall go free too\u2013on the understanding, of course, that neither of you interfere with me in the",
        "future.\u2019 \u2018And what guarantee have I that you will keep your side of the bargain?\u2019 \u2018None whatever, my",
        "dear girl.",
        "You\u2019ll have to trust me and hope for the best.",
        "Of course, if you\u2019re in an heroic mood and prefer annihilation, that\u2019s another matter.\u2019 This was what I",
        "had been playing for.",
        "I was careful not to jump at the bait.",
        "Gradually I allowed myself to be bullied and cajoled into yielding.",
        "I wrote at Sir Eustace\u2019s dictation: \u2018Dear Harry, I think I see a chance of establishing your innocence",
        "beyond any possible doubt.",
        "Please follow my instructions minutely.",
        "Go to Agrasato\u2019s curioshop.",
        "Ask to see something \u201cout of the ordinary\u201d, \u201cfor a special occasion\u201d.",
        "The man will then ask you to \u201ccome into the back room\u201d.",
        "Go with him.",
        "You will find a messenger who will bring you tome.",
        "Do exactly as he tells you.",
        "Be sure and bring the diamonds with you.",
        "Not a word to anyone.\u2019 Sir Eustace stopped. \u2018I leave the fancy touches to your own imagination,\u2019 he",
        "remarked. \u2018But be careful to make no mistakes.\u2019 \u2018\u201cYours for ever and ever, Anne,\u201d will be sufficient,\u2019 I",
        "remarked.",
        "I wrote in the words.",
        "Sir Eustace stretched out his hand for the letter and read it through. \u2018That seems all right.",
        "Now the address.\u2019 I gave it him.",
        "It was that of a small shop which received letters and telegrams for a consideration.",
        "He struck the bell upon the table with his hand.",
        "Chichester-Pettigrew, alias Minks, answered the summons. \u2018This letter is to go immediately\u2013the usual route.\u2019 \u2018Very well, Colonel.\u2019 He",
        "looked at the name on the envelope.",
        "Sir Eustace was watching him keenly. \u2018A friend of yours, I think?\u2019 \u2018Of mine?\u2019 The man seemed startled.",
        "\u2018You had a prolonged conversation with him in Johannesburg yesterday.\u2019 \u2018A man came up and questioned me about",
        "your movements and those of Colonel Race.",
        "I gave him misleading information.\u2019 \u2018Excellent, my dear fellow, excellent,\u2019 said Sir Eustace genially. \u2018My mistake.\u2019 I chanced",
        "to look at Chichester-Pettigrew as he left the room.",
        "He was white to the lips, as though in deadly terror.",
        "No sooner was he outside, than Sir Eustace picked up a speaking-tube that rested by his elbow, and",
        "spoke down it. \u2018That you, Schwart?",
        "Watch Minks.",
        "He\u2019s not to leave the house without orders.\u2019 He put the speaking-tube down again, and frowned, slightly tapping",
        "the table with his hand. \u2018May I ask you a few questions, Sir Eustace,\u2019 I said, after a",
        "minute or two of silence. \u2018Certainly.",
        "What excellent nerves you have, Anne!",
        "You are capable of taking an intelligent interest in things when most girls would be sniffling and wringing",
        "their hands.\u2019 \u2018Why did you take Harry as your secretary instead of giving him up to the police?\u2019",
        "\u2018I wanted those cursed diamonds.",
        "Nadina, the little devil, was playing off your Harry against me.",
        "Unless I gave her the price she wanted, she threatened to sell them back to him.",
        "That was another mistake I made\u2013I thought she\u2019d have them with her that day.",
        "But she was too clever for that.",
        "Carton, her husband, was dead too\u2013I\u2019d no clue whatsoever as to where the diamonds were hidden.",
        "Then I managed to get a copy of a wireless message sent to Nadina by someone on board",
        "the Kilmorden \u2013either Carton or Rayburn, I didn\u2019t know which.",
        "It was a duplicate of that piece of paper you picked up.",
        "\u201cSeventeen one twenty two\u201d, it ran.",
        "I took it to be an appointment with Rayburn, and when he was so desperate to get aboard",
        "the Kilmorden I was convinced that I was right.",
        "So I pretended to swallow his statements, and let him come.",
        "I kept a pretty sharp watch upon him and hoped that I should learn more.",
        "Then I found Minks trying to play a lone hand, and interfering with me.",
        "I soon stopped that.",
        "He came to heel all right.",
        "It was annoying not getting Cabin 17, and it worried me not being able to place you.",
        "Were you the innocent young girl you seemed, or were you not?",
        "When Rayburn set out to keep the appointment that night, Minks was told off to intercept him.",
        "Minks muffed it, of course.\u2019 \u2018But why did the wireless message say \u201cseventeen\u201d instead of \u201cseventy-one\u201d?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ve thought",
        "that out.",
        "Carton must have given that wireless operator his own memorandum to copy off on to a form, and",
        "he never read the copy through.",
        "The operator made the same mistake we all did, and read it as 17.1.22 instead of 1.71.22.",
        "The thing I don\u2019t know is how Minks got on to Cabin 17.",
        "It must have been sheer instinct.\u2019 \u2018And the dispatch to General Smuts?",
        "Who tampered with that?\u2019 \u2018My dear Anne, you don\u2019t suppose I was going to have a lot of",
        "my plans given away, without making an effort to save them?",
        "With an escaped murderer as a secretary, I had no hesitation whatever in substituting blanks.",
        "Nobody would think of suspecting poor old Pedler.\u2019 \u2018What about Colonel Race?\u2019 \u2018Yes, that was a nasty jar.",
        "When Pagett told me he was a Secret Service fellow, I had an unpleasant feeling down the spine.",
        "I remembered that he\u2019d been nosing around Nadina in Paris during the War\u2013and I had a horrible suspicion",
        "that he was out after me !",
        "I don\u2019t like the way he\u2019s stuck to me ever since.",
        "He\u2019s one of those strong, silent men who have always got something up their sleeve.\u2019 A whistle sounded.",
        "Sir Eustace picked up the tube, listened for a minute or two, then answered: \u2018Very well, I\u2019ll see",
        "him now.\u2019 \u2018Business,\u2019 he remarked. \u2018Miss Anne, let me show you your room.\u2019 He ushered me into a",
        "small shabby apartment, a Kafir boy brought up my small suit-case, and Sir Eustace, urging me to ask",
        "for anything I wanted, withdrew, the picture of a courteous host.",
        "A can of hot water was on the washstand, and I proceeded to unpack a few necessaries.",
        "Something hard and unfamiliar in my sponge-bag puzzled me greatly.",
        "I untied the string and looked inside.",
        "To my utter amazement I drew out a small pearl-handled revolver.",
        "It hadn\u2019t been there when I started from Kimberley.",
        "I examined the thing gingerly.",
        "It appeared to be loaded.",
        "I handled it with a comfortable feeling.",
        "It was a useful thing to have in a house such as this.",
        "But modern clothes are quite unsuited to the carrying of fire-arms.",
        "In the end I pushed it gingerly into the top of my stocking.",
        "It made a terrible bulge, and I expected every minute that it would go off and shoot me",
        "in the leg, but it really seemed the only place.",
        "Chapter 33 I was not summoned to Sir Eustace\u2019s presence until late in the afternoon.",
        "Eleven-o\u2019clock tea and a substantial lunch had been served to me in my own apartment, and I felt",
        "fortified for further conflict.",
        "Sir Eustace was alone.",
        "He was walking up and down the room, there was a gleam in his eye and a restlessness",
        "in his manner which did not escape me.",
        "He was exultant about something.",
        "There was a subtle change in his manner towards me. \u2018I have news for you.",
        "Your young man is on his way.",
        "He will be here in a few minutes.",
        "Moderate your transports\u2013I have something more to say.",
        "You attempted to deceive me this morning.",
        "I warned you that you would be wise to stick to the truth, and up to a certain",
        "point you obeyed me.",
        "Then you ran off the rails.",
        "You attempted to make me believe that the diamonds were in Harry Rayburn\u2019s possession.",
        "At the time I accepted your statement because it facilitated my task\u2013the task of inducing you to decoy",
        "Harry Rayburn here.",
        "But, my dear Anne, the diamonds have been in my possession ever since I left the Falls\u2013though I",
        "only discovered the fact yesterday.\u2019 \u2018You know!\u2019 I gasped. \u2018It may interest you to hear that it was",
        "Pagett who gave the show away.",
        "He insisted on boring me with a long pointless story about a wager and a tin of films.",
        "It didn\u2019t take me long to put two and two together\u2013Mrs Blair\u2019s distrust of Colonel Race, her agitation,",
        "her entreaty that I would take care of her souvenirs for her.",
        "The excellent Pagett had already unfastened the cases through an excess of zeal.",
        "Before leaving the hotel, I simply transferred all the rolls of films to my own pocket.",
        "They are in the corner there.",
        "I admit that I haven\u2019t had time to examine them yet, but I notice that one is of",
        "a totally different weight to the others, rattles in a peculiar fashion, and has evidently been stuck down",
        "with seccotine, which will necessitate the use of a tin-opener.",
        "The case seems clear, does it not?",
        "And now, you see, I have you both nicely in the trap\u2026It\u2019s a pity that you didn\u2019t take",
        "kindly to the idea of becoming Lady Pedler.\u2019 I did not answer.",
        "I stood looking at him.",
        "There was the sound of feet on the stairs, the door was flung open, and Harry Rayburn was",
        "hustled into the room between two men.",
        "Sir Eustace flung me a look of triumph. \u2018According to plan,\u2019 he said softly. \u2018You amateurs will pit",
        "yourselves against professionals.\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s the meaning of this?\u2019 cried Harry hoarsely. \u2018It means that you have walked into",
        "my parlour\u2013said the spider to the fly,\u2019 remarked Sir Eustace facetiously. \u2018My dear Rayburn, you are extraordinarily unlucky.\u2019",
        "\u2018You said I could come safely, Anne.\u2019 \u2018Do not reproach her, my dear fellow.",
        "That note was written at my dictation, and the lady could not help herself.",
        "She would have been wiser not to write it, but I did not tell her so at the",
        "time.",
        "You followed her instructions, went to the curioshop, were taken through the secret passage from the back room\u2013and",
        "found yourself in the hands of your enemies!\u2019 Harry looked at me.",
        "I understood his glance and edged nearer to Sir Eustace. \u2018Yes,\u2019 murmured the latter, \u2018decidedly you are not",
        "lucky!",
        "This is\u2013let me see, the third encounter.\u2019 \u2018You are right,\u2019 said Harry. \u2018This is the third encounter.",
        "Twice you have worsted me\u2013have you never heard that the third time the luck changes?",
        "This is my round\u2013cover him, Anne.\u2019 I was all ready.",
        "In a flash I had whipped the pistol out of my stocking and was holding it to his",
        "head.",
        "The two men guarding Harry sprang forward, but his voice stopped them. \u2018Another step\u2013and he dies!",
        "If they come any nearer, Anne, pull the trigger\u2013don\u2019t hesitate.\u2019 \u2018I shan\u2019t,\u2019 I replied cheerfully. \u2018I\u2019m rather afraid",
        "of pulling it, anyway.\u2019 I think Sir Eustace shared my fears.",
        "He was certainly shaking like a jelly. \u2018Stay where you are,\u2019 he commanded, and the men stopped obediently.",
        "\u2018Tell them to leave the room,\u2019 said Harry.",
        "Sir Eustace gave the order.",
        "The men filed out, and Harry shot the bolt across the door behind them. \u2018Now we can talk,\u2019",
        "he observed grimly, and, coming across the room, he took the revolver out of my hand.",
        "Sir Eustace uttered a sigh of relief and wiped his forehead with a handkerchief. \u2018I\u2019m shockingly out of",
        "condition,\u2019 he observed. \u2018I think I must have a weak heart.",
        "I am glad that revolver is in competent hands.",
        "I didn\u2019t trust Miss Anne with it.",
        "Well, my young friend, as you say, now we can talk.",
        "I\u2019m willing to admit that you stole a march upon me.",
        "Where the devil that revolver came from I don\u2019t know.",
        "I had the girl\u2019s luggage searched when she arrived.",
        "And where did you produce it from now?",
        "You hadn\u2019t got it on you a minute ago?\u2019 \u2018Yes, I had,\u2019 I replied. \u2018It was in my",
        "stocking.\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know enough about women.",
        "I ought to have studied them more,\u2019 said Sir Eustace sadly. \u2018I wonder if Pagett would have known",
        "that?\u2019 Harry rapped sharply on the table. \u2018Don\u2019t play the fool.",
        "If it weren\u2019t for your grey hairs, I\u2019d throw you out of the window.",
        "You damned scoundrel!",
        "Grey hairs, or no grey hairs, I\u2013\u2019 He advanced a step or two, and Sir Eustace skipped nimbly",
        "behind the table. \u2018The young are always so violent,\u2019 he said reproachfully. \u2018Unable to use their brains, they",
        "rely solely on their muscles.",
        "Let us talk sense.",
        "For the moment you have the upper hand.",
        "But that state of affairs cannot continue.",
        "The house is full of my men.",
        "You are hopelessly outnumbered.",
        "Your momentary ascendancy has been gained by an accident\u2013\u2019 \u2018Has it?\u2019 Something in Harry\u2019s voice, a grim raillery,",
        "seemed to attract Sir Eustace\u2019s attention.",
        "He stared at him. \u2018Has it?\u2019 said Harry again. \u2018Sit down, Sir Eustace, and listen to what I",
        "have to say.\u2019 Still covering him with the revolver, he went on: \u2018The cards are against you this",
        "time.",
        "To begin with, listen to that !\u2019 That was a dull banging at the door below.",
        "There were shouts, oaths, and then a sound of firing.",
        "Sir Eustace paled. \u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 \u2018Race\u2013and his people.",
        "You didn\u2019t know, did you, Sir Eustace, that Anne had an arrangement with me by which we should",
        "know whether communications from one to the other were genuine?",
        "Telegrams were to be signed \u201cAndy\u201d, letters were to have the word \u201cand\u201d crossed out somewhere in them.",
        "Anne knew that your telegram was a fake.",
        "She came here of her own free will, walked deliberately into the snare, in the hope that she",
        "might catch you in your own trap.",
        "Before leaving Kimberley she wired both to me and to Race.",
        "Mrs Blair has been in communication with us ever since.",
        "I received the letter written at your dictation, which was just what I expected.",
        "I had already discussed the probabilities of a secret passage leading out of the curioshop with Race, and",
        "he had discovered the place where the exit was situated.\u2019 There was a screaming, tearing sound, and a",
        "heavy explosion which shook the room. \u2018They\u2019re shelling this part of the town.",
        "I must get you out of here, Anne.\u2019 A bright light flared up.",
        "The house opposite was on fire.",
        "Sir Eustace had risen and was pacing up and down.",
        "Harry kept him covered with the revolver. \u2018So you see, Sir Eustace, the game is up.",
        "It was you yourself who very kindly provided us with the clue of your whereabouts.",
        "Race\u2019s men were watching the exit of the secret passage.",
        "In spite of the precautions you took, they were successful in following me here.\u2019 Sir Eustace turned suddenly.",
        "\u2018Very clever.",

        "You\u2019ll never be able to bring the murder of Nadina home to me.",
        "I was in Marlow on that day, that\u2019s all you\u2019ve got against me.",
        "No one can prove that I even knew the woman.",
        "But you knew her, you had a motive for killing her\u2013and your record\u2019s against you.",
        "You\u2019re a thief, remember, a thief.",
        "There\u2019s one thing you don\u2019t know, perhaps.",
        "I\u2019ve got the diamonds .",
        "And here goes\u2013\u2019 With an incredibly swift movement, he stooped, swung up his arm and threw.",
        "There was a tinkle of breaking glass, as the object went through the window and disappeared into the",
        "blazing mass opposite. \u2018There goes your only hope of establishing your innocence over the Kimberley affair.",
        "And now we\u2019ll talk.",
        "I\u2019ll drive a bargain with you.",
        "You\u2019ve got me cornered.",
        "Race will find all he needs in this house.",
        "There\u2019s a chance for me if I can get away.",
        "I\u2019m done for if I stay, but so are you, young man!",
        "There\u2019s a skylight in the next room.",
        "A couple of minutes\u2019 start and I shall be all right.",
        "I\u2019ve got one or two little arrangements all ready made.",
        "You let me out of the way, and give me a start\u2013and I leave you a signed confession",
        "that I killed Nadina.\u2019 \u2018 Yes , Harry,\u2019 I cried. \u2018Yes, yes, yes!\u2019 He turned a stern face",
        "on me. \u2018No, Anne, a thousand times, no.",
        "You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying.\u2019 \u2018I do.",
        "It solves everything.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019d never be able to look Race in the face again.",
        "I\u2019ll take my chance, but I\u2019m damned if I\u2019ll let this slippery old fox get away.",
        "It\u2019s no good, Anne.",
        "I won\u2019t do it.\u2019 Sir Eustace chuckled.",
        "He accepted defeat without the least emotion. \u2018Well, well,\u2019 he remarked. \u2018You seem to have met your master,",
        "Anne.",
        "But I can assure you both that moral rectitude does not always pay.\u2019 There was a crash of",
        "rending wood, and footsteps surged up the stairs.",
        "Harry drew back the bolt.",
        "Colonel Race was the first to enter the room.",
        "His face lit at the sight of us. \u2018You\u2019re safe, Anne.",
        "I was afraid\u2013\u2019 He turned to Sir Eustace. \u2018I\u2019ve been after you for a long time, Pedler\u2013and at",
        "last I\u2019ve got you.\u2019 \u2018Everybody seems to have gone completely mad,\u2019 declared Sir Eustace airily. \u2018These young people",
        "have been threatening me with revolvers and accusing me of the most shocking things.",
        "I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s all about.\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t you?",
        "It means that I\u2019ve found the \u201cColonel\u201d.",
        "It means that on January 8th last you were not at Cannes, but at Marlow.",
        "It means that when your tool, Madame Nadina, turned against you, you planned to do away with her\u2013and",
        "at last we shall be able to bring the crime home to you.\u2019 \u2018Indeed?",
        "And from whom did you get all this interesting information?",
        "From the man who is even now being looked for by the police?",
        "His evidence will be very valuable.\u2019 \u2018We have other evidence.",
        "There is someone else who knew that Nadina was going to meet you at the Mill House.\u2019 Sir",
        "Eustace looked surprised.",
        "Colonel Race made a gesture with his hand.",
        "Arthur Minks alias the Rev.",
        "Edward Chichester alias Miss Pettigrew stepped forward.",
        "He was pale and nervous, but he spoke clearly enough: \u2018I saw Nadina in Paris the night before",
        "she went over to England.",
        "I was posing at the time as a Russian Count.",
        "She told me of her purpose.",
        "I warned her, knowing what kind of man she had to deal with, but she did not take",
        "my advice.",
        "There was a wireless message on the table.",
        "I read it.",
        "Afterwards I thought I would have a try for the diamonds myself.",
        "In Johannesburg Mr Rayburn accosted me.",
        "He persuaded me to come over to his side.\u2019 Sir Eustace looked at him.",
        "He said nothing, but Minks seemed visibly to wilt. \u2018Rats always leave a sinking ship,\u2019 observed Sir Eustace.",
        "\u2018I don\u2019t care for rats.",
        "Sooner or later, I destroy vermin.\u2019 \u2018There\u2019s just one thing I\u2019d like to tell you, Sir Eustace,\u2019 I",
        "remarked. \u2018That tin you threw out of the window didn\u2019t contain the diamonds.",
        "It had common pebbles in it.",
        "The diamonds are in a perfectly safe place.",
        "As a matter of fact they\u2019re in the big giraffe\u2019s stomach.",
        "Suzanne hollowed it out, put the diamonds in with cotton wool, so that they wouldn\u2019t rattle, and plugged",
        "it up again.\u2019 Sir Eustace looked at me for some time.",
        "His reply was characteristic: \u2018I always did hate that blinking giraffe,\u2019 he said. \u2018It must have been instinct.\u2019",
        "Chapter 34 We were not able to return to Johannesburg that night.",
        "The shells were coming over pretty fast, and I gathered that we were now more or less cut",
        "off, owing to the rebels having obtained possession of a new part of the suburbs.",
        "Our place of refuge was a farm some twenty miles or so from Johannesburg\u2013right out on the veld.",
        "I was dropping with fatigue.",
        "All the excitement and anxiety of the last two days had left me little better than a limp",
        "rag.",
        "I kept repeating to myself, without being able to believe it, that our troubles were really over.",
        "Harry and I were together and we should never be separated again.",
        "Yet all through I was conscious of some barrier between us\u2013a constraint on his part, the reason of",
        "which I could not fathom.",
        "Sir Eustace had been driven off in an opposite direction accompanied by a strong guard.",
        "He waved his hand airily to us on departing.",
        "I came out on to the stoep early on the following morning and looked across the veld in",
        "the direction of Johannesburg.",
        "I could see the great dumps glistening in the pale morning sunshine, and I could hear the low",
        "rumbling mutter of the guns.",
        "The Revolution was not over yet.",
        "The farmer\u2019s wife came out and called me in to breakfast.",
        "She was a kind, motherly soul, and I was already very fond of her.",
        "Harry had gone out at dawn and had not yet returned, so she informed me.",
        "Again I felt a stir of uneasiness pass over me.",
        "What was this shadow of which I was so conscious between us?",
        "After breakfast I sat out on the stoep , a book in my hand which I did not",
        "read.",
        "I was so lost in my own thoughts that I never saw Colonel Race ride up and dismount",
        "from his horse.",
        "It was not until he said \u2018Good morning, Anne,\u2019 that I became aware of his presence. \u2018Oh,\u2019 I",
        "said, with a flush, \u2018it\u2019s you.\u2019 \u2018Yes.",
        "May I sit down?\u2019 He drew a chair up beside me.",
        "It was the first time we had been alone together since that day at the Matopos.",
        "As always, I felt that curious mixture of fascination and fear that he never failed to inspire in",
        "me. \u2018What is the news?\u2019 I asked. \u2018Smuts will be in Johannesburg tomorrow.",
        "I give this outbreak three days more before it collapses utterly.",
        "In the meantime the fighting goes on.\u2019 \u2018I wish,\u2019 I said, \u2018that one could be sure that the",
        "right people were the ones to get killed.",
        "I mean the ones who wanted to fight\u2013not just all the poor people who happen to live in",
        "the parts where the fighting is going on.\u2019 He nodded. \u2018I know what you mean, Anne.",
        "That\u2019s the unfairness of war.",
        "But I\u2019ve other news for you.\u2019 \u2018Yes?\u2019 \u2018A confession of incompetency on my part.",
        "Pedler has managed to escape.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018Yes.",
        "No one knows how he managed it.",
        "He was securely locked up for the night\u2013in an upper-story room of one of the farms roundabouts which",
        "the Military have taken over, but this morning the room was empty and the bird had flown.\u2019 Secretly,",
        "I was rather pleased.",
        "Never, to this day, have I been able to rid myself of a sneaking fondness for Sir Eustace.",
        "I dare say it\u2019s reprehensible, but there it is.",
        "I admired him.",
        "He was a thorough-going villain, I dare say\u2013but he was a pleasant one.",
        "I\u2019ve never met anyone half so amusing since.",
        "I concealed my feelings, of course.",
        "Naturally Colonel Race would feel quite differently about it.",
        "He wanted Sir Eustace brought to justice.",
        "There was nothing very surprising in his escape when one came to think of it.",
        "All round Jo\u2019burg he must have innumerable spies and agents.",
        "And, whatever Colonel Race might think, I was exceedingly doubtful that they would ever catch him.",
        "He probably had a well-planned line of retreat.",
        "Indeed, he had said as much to us.",
        "I expressed myself suitably, though in a rather lukewarm manner, and the conversation languished.",
        "Then Colonel Race asked suddenly for Harry.",
        "I told him that he had gone off at dawn and that I hadn\u2019t seen him this morning.",
        "\u2018You understand, don\u2019t you, Anne, that apart from formalities, he is completely cleared?",
        "There are technicalities, of course, but Sir Eustace\u2019s guilt is well assured.",
        "There is nothing now to keep you apart.\u2019 He said this without looking at me, in a slow,",
        "jerky voice. \u2018I understand,\u2019 I said gratefully. \u2018And there is no reason why he should not at once",
        "resume his real name.\u2019 \u2018No, of course not.\u2019 \u2018You know his real name?\u2019 The question surprised me. \u2018Of",
        "course I do.",
        "Harry Lucas.\u2019 He did not answer, and something in the quality of his silence struck me as peculiar.",
        "\u2018Anne, do you remember that, as we drove home from the Matopos that day, I told you that",
        "I knew what I had to do?\u2019 \u2018Of course I remember.\u2019 \u2018I think that I may fairly say",
        "I have done it.",
        "The man you love is cleared of suspicion.\u2019 \u2018Was that what you meant?\u2019 \u2018Of course.\u2019 I hung my",
        "head, ashamed of the baseless suspicion I had entertained.",
        "He spoke again in a thoughtful voice: \u2018When I was a mere youngster, I was in love with",
        "a girl who jilted me.",
        "After that I thought only of my work.",
        "My career meant everything to me.",
        "Then I met you, Anne\u2013and all that seemed worth nothing.",
        "But youth calls to youth\u2026I\u2019ve still got my work.\u2019 I was silent.",
        "I suppose one can\u2019t really love two men at once\u2013but you can feel like it.",
        "The magnetism of this man was very great.",
        "I looked up at him suddenly. \u2018I think that you\u2019ll go very far,\u2019 I said dreamily. \u2018I think",
        "that you\u2019ve got a great career ahead of you.",
        "You\u2019ll be one of the world\u2019s big men.\u2019 I felt as though I was uttering a prophecy. \u2018I",
        "shall be alone, though.\u2019 \u2018All the people who do really big things are.\u2019 \u2018You think so?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m sure",
        "of it.\u2019 He took my hand, and said in a low voice: \u2018I\u2019d rather have had\u2013the other.\u2019 Then",
        "Harry came striding round the corner of the house.",
        "Colonel Race rose. \u2018Good morning\u2013Lucas,\u2019 he said.",
        "For some reason Harry flushed up to the roots of his hair. \u2018Yes,\u2019 I said gaily, \u2018you must",
        "be known by your real name now.\u2019 But Harry was still staring at Colonel Race. \u2018So you know,",
        "sir,\u2019 he said at last. \u2018I never forget a face.",
        "I saw you once as a boy.\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s all this about?\u2019 I asked, puzzled, looking from one to",
        "the other.",
        "It seemed a conflict of wills between them.",
        "Race won.",
        "Harry turned slightly away. \u2018I suppose you\u2019re right, sir.",
        "Tell her my real name.\u2019 \u2018Anne, this isn\u2019t Harry Lucas.",
        "Harry Lucas was killed in the War.",
        "This is John Harold Eardsley.\u2019 Chapter 35 With his last words, Colonel Race had swung away and left",
        "us.",
        "I stood staring after him.",
        "Harry\u2019s voice recalled me to myself. \u2018Anne, forgive me, say you forgive me.\u2019 He took my hand in",
        "his and almost mechanically I drew it away. \u2018Why did you deceive me?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know that I",
        "can make you understand.",
        "I was afraid of all that sort of thing\u2013the power and fascination of wealth.",
        "I wanted you to care for me just for myself\u2013for the man I was\u2013without ornaments and trappings.\u2019 \u2018You",
        "mean you didn\u2019t trust me?\u2019 \u2018You can put it that way if you like, but it isn\u2019t quite",
        "true.",
        "I\u2019d become embittered, suspicious\u2013always prone to look for ulterior motives\u2013and it was so wonderful to be cared for",
        "in the way you cared for me.\u2019 \u2018I see,\u2019 I said slowly.",
        "I was going over in my own mind the story he had told me.",
        "For the first time I noted discrepancies in it which I had disregarded\u2013an assurance of money, the power",
        "to buy back the diamonds of Nadina, the way in which he had preferred to speak of both",
        "men from the point of view of an outsider.",
        "And when he had said \u2018my friend\u2019 he had meant not Eardsley, but Lucas.",
        "It was Lucas, the quiet fellow, who had loved Nadina so deeply. \u2018How did it come about?\u2019 I",
        "asked. \u2018We were both reckless\u2013anxious to get killed.",
        "One night we exchanged identification discs\u2013for luck!",
        "Lucas was killed the next day\u2013blown to pieces.\u2019 I shuddered. \u2018But why didn\u2019t you tell me now?",
        "This morning?",
        "You couldn\u2019t have doubted my caring for you by this time?\u2019 \u2018Anne, I didn\u2019t want to spoil it",
        "all.",
        "I wanted to take you back to the island.",
        "What\u2019s the good of money?",
        "It can\u2019t buy happiness.",
        "We\u2019d have been happy on the island.",
        "I tell you I\u2019m afraid of that other life\u2013it nearly rotted me through once.\u2019 \u2018Did Sir Eustace know",
        "who you really were?\u2019 \u2018Oh, yes.\u2019 \u2018And Carton?\u2019 \u2018No.",
        "He saw us both with Nadina at Kimberley one night, but he didn\u2019t know which was which.",
        "He accepted my statement that I was Lucas, and Nadina was deceived by his cable.",
        "She was never afraid of Lucas.",
        "He was a quiet chap\u2013very deep.",
        "But I always had the devil\u2019s own temper.",
        "She\u2019d have been scared out of her life if she\u2019d known that I\u2019d come to life again.\u2019 \u2018Harry,",
        "if Colonel Race hadn\u2019t told me, what did you mean to do?\u2019 \u2018Say nothing.",
        "Go on as Lucas.\u2019 \u2018And your father\u2019s millions?\u2019 \u2018Race was welcome to them.",
        "Anyway, he would make a better use of them than I ever shall.",
        "Anne, what are you thinking about?",
        "You\u2019re frowning so.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m thinking,\u2019 I said slowly, \u2018that I almost wish Colonel Race hadn\u2019t made you tell",
        "me.\u2019 \u2018No.",
        "He was right.",
        "I owed you the truth.\u2019 He paused, then said suddenly: \u2018You know, Anne, I\u2019m jealous of Race.",
        "He loves you too\u2013and he\u2019s a bigger man than I am or ever shall be.\u2019 I turned to",
        "him, laughing. \u2018Harry, you idiot.",
        "It\u2019s you I want\u2013and that\u2019s all that matters.\u2019 As soon as possible we started for Cape Town.",
        "There Suzanne was waiting to greet me, and we disembowelled the big giraffe together.",
        "When the Revolution was finally quelled, Colonel Race came down to Cape Town and at his suggestion the",
        "big villa at Muizenberg that had belonged to Sir Laurence Eardsley was reopened and we all took up",
        "our abode in it.",
        "There we made our plans.",
        "I was to return to England with Suzanne and to be married from her house in London.",
        "And the trousseau was to be bought in Paris!",
        "Suzanne enjoyed planning all these details enormously.",
        "So did I.",
        "And yet the future seemed curiously unreal.",
        "And sometimes, without knowing why, I felt absolutely stifled\u2013as though I couldn\u2019t breathe.",
        "It was the night before we were to sail.",
        "I couldn\u2019t sleep.",
        "I was miserable, and I didn\u2019t know why.",
        "I hated leaving Africa.",
        "When I came back to it, would it be the same thing?",
        "Would it ever be the same thing again?",
        "And then I was startled by an authoritative rap on the shutter.",
        "I sprang up.",
        "Harry was on the stoep outside. \u2018Put some clothes on, Anne, and come out.",
        "I want to speak to you.\u2019 I huddled on a few garments, and stepped out into the cool",
        "night air\u2013still and scented, with its velvety feel.",
        "Harry beckoned me out of earshot of the house.",
        "His face looked pale and determined and his eyes were blazing. \u2018Anne, do you remember saying to me",
        "once that women enjoyed doing things they disliked for the sake of someone they liked?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 I said,",
        "wondering what was coming.",
        "He caught me in his arms. \u2018Anne, come away with me\u2013now\u2013tonight.",
        "Back to Rhodesia\u2013back to the island.",
        "I can\u2019t stand all this tomfoolery.",
        "I can\u2019t wait for you any longer.\u2019 I disengaged myself a minute. \u2018And what about my French frocks?\u2019",
        "I lamented mockingly.",
        "To this day, Harry never knows when I\u2019m in earnest, and when I\u2019m only teasing him. \u2018Damn your",
        "French frocks.",
        "Do you think I want to put frocks on you?",
        "I\u2019m a damned sight more likely to want to tear them off you.",
        "I\u2019m not going to let you go, do you hear?",
        "You\u2019re my woman.",
        "If I let you go away, I may lose you.",
        "I\u2019m never sure of you.",
        "You\u2019re coming with me now\u2013tonight\u2013and damn everybody.\u2019 He held me to him, kissing me until I could hardly",
        "breathe. \u2018I can\u2019t do without you any longer, Anne.",
        "I can\u2019t indeed.",
        "I hate all this money.",
